  <title>Theorem and Conjecture</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Theorems are true mathematical statements that we can prove.
      These include important and widely applicable
      <q>named theorems</q>
      like the Pythagorean theorem,
      the fundamental theorem of calculus,
      and the rank-nullity theorem as well as simpler ones like <xref ref="thm_even_sum">Theorem</xref>.
      Essentially, if you can prove it, then it's a theorem.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what if we're confronted with a statement that we don't know how to prove?
      It would be a bit arrogant of us to conclude that the statement is false just because we don't know how to prove it.
      Statements that we believe to be true,
      but don't yet know how to prove are called <em>conjectures</em>.
      Conjectures push the boundaries of math as we know it.
      Much of the creativity in mathematics comes from the pursuit of proving or disproving conjectures.
      When you think about it,
      we can't lose <mdash/> we learn something new if we prove the conjecture true <em>or</em> false.
    </p>
    <p>
      A conjecture is the mathematician's equivalent of the experimental scientist's hypothesis:
      a statement that one would like to be true.
      The difference lies in what comes next.
      The mathematician will try to prove that a conjecture is undeniably true by relying on logic,
      while the scientist will apply the scientific method,
      conducting experiments attempting,
      and hopefully failing, to show that a hypothesis is incorrect.
      To get a taste, consider the following.
    </p>
    <conjecture xml:id="conj_n_2-1">
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>n</m> is any odd integer,
          then <m>n^2-1</m> is a multiple of 8.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </conjecture>
    <conjecture xml:id="conj_n_2_n_41">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For every positive integer <m>n</m>,
          the integer <m>n^2+n+41</m> is prime.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </conjecture>
    <p>
      Once a mathematician proves the validity of a conjecture it becomes a <em>theorem.</em>
      The job of a mathematics researcher is thus to formulate conjectures,
      prove them,
      and publish the resulting theorems.
      The creativity lies as much in the formulation as in the proof.
      As you go through the class, try to formulate conjectures.
      Like as not, many of your conjectures will be false,
      but you'll gain a lot from trying to form them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us return to our conjectures:
      are they true or false?
      How can we decide?
      As a first attempt,
      we may try to test the conjectures by computing with some small integers <m>n</m>.
      In practice this would be done <em>before</em> stating the conjectures.
      <me>
        \begin{array}{l||c|c|c|c|c|c|c} n \amp  1 \amp  3 \amp  5 \amp  7 \amp  9 \amp  11 \amp  13\\\hline n^2-1 \amp  0 \amp  8 \amp  24 \amp  48 \amp  80 \amp  120 \amp  168 \end{array} \qquad\qquad \begin{array}{l||c|c|c|c|c|c|c} n \amp  1 \amp  2 \amp  3 \amp  4 \amp  5 \amp  6 \amp  7\\\hline n^2+n+41 \amp  43 \amp  47 \amp  53 \amp  61 \amp  71 \amp  83 \amp  97 \end{array}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Because 0, 8, 24, 48, 80, 120 and 168 are all multiples of 8, and 43, 47, 53, 61, 71, 83 and 97 are all prime,
      both conjectures appear to be true.
      Would you bet $100 that this is indeed the case?
      Is <m>n^2-1</m> a multiple of 8
      <em>for every</em> odd integer <m>n</m>?
      Is <m>n^2+n+41</m> prime <em>for every</em>
      positive integer <m>n</m>?
      The only way to establish whether a conjecture is true or false is by doing one of the following:
      <ul>
        <li class="custom-list-style-type">
          <p>
            <em>Prove it</em> by showing it must be true in <em>all</em> cases, or,
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="custom-list-style-type">
          <p>
            <em>Disprove it</em> by finding <em>at least</em>
            one instance in which the conjecture is false.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us work with <xref ref="conj_n_2-1">Conjecture</xref>.
      If <m>n</m> is an odd integer, then, by definition,
      we can write it as <m>n=2k+1</m> for some integer <m>k</m>.
      Then
      <me>
        n^2-1 = (2k+1)^2-1 = (4k^2 +1+4k) -1 = 4k^2 + 4k
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We need to investigate whether this is
      <em>always</em> a multiple of 8.
      Since
      <me>
        4k^2 + 4k = 4(k^2+k)
      </me>
      is already a multiple of 4, it all comes down to deciding whether or not <m>k^2+k</m> contains a factor 2 for all possible choices of <m>k</m>;
      i.e. is <m>k^2+k</m> even?
      Do we believe this?
      We can return to trying out some small values of <m>k</m>:
      <me>
        \begin{array}{l||c|c|c|c|c|c|c} k \amp  -2 \amp  -1 \amp  0 \amp  1 \amp  2 \amp  3 \amp  4\\\hline k^2+k \amp  2 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  2 \amp  6 \amp  12 \amp  20 \end{array}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Once again, the claim seems to be true for small values of <m>k</m>,
      but how do we know it is true for <em>all</em> <m>k</m>?
      Again, the only way is to <em>prove it</em> or <em>disprove it</em>.
      How to proceed?
      The question here is whether or not <m>k^2+k</m> is <em>always</em> even.
      Factoring out <m>k</m>, we get:
      <me>
        k^2+k = k(k+1)
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have therefore expressed <m>k^2+k</m> as a product of two consecutive integers.
      This is great, because for any two consecutive integers,
      one is even and the other is odd,
      and so their product must be even.
      We have now proved that the conjecture is true.
      <xref ref="conj_n_2-1">Conjecture</xref> is indeed a <em>theorem!</em>
      Everything we've done so far has been investigative,
      and is laid out in an untidy way.
      We don't want the reader to have to wade through all of our scratch work,
      so we formalize the above argument.
      This is the final result of our deliberations;
      investigate, spot a pattern, conjecture, prove,
      and finally present your work in as clean and convincing a manner as you can.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>n</m> is any odd integer,
          then <m>n^2-1</m> is a multiple of 8.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>n</m> be any odd integer;
        we want to show that <m>n^2-1</m> is a multiple of 8.
        By the definition of <em>odd</em> integer,
        we may write <m>n=2k+1</m> for some integer <m>k</m>.
        Then
        <me>
          n^2-1=(2k+1)^2-1=(4k^2+1+4k)-1=4k^2+4k=4k(k+1)
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We distinguish two cases.
        If <m>k</m> is even,
        then <m>k(k+1)</m> is even and so <m>4k(k+1)</m> is divisible by 8.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>k</m> is odd, then <m>k+1</m> is even.
        Therefore <m>k(k+1)</m> is again even and <m>4k(k+1)</m> divisible by 8.
      </p>
      <p>
        In both cases <m>n^2-1=4k(k+1)</m> is divisible by 8.
        This concludes the proof.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      It is now time to explore <xref ref="conj_n_2_n_41">Conjecture</xref>.
      The question here is whether or not
      <m>n^2+n+41</m> is a prime integer for <em>every</em>
      positive integer <m>n</m>.
      We know that when <m>n=1,\,2,\,3,\,4,\,5,\,6</m> or 7 the answer is yes,
      but examples do not make a proof.
      At this point,
      we do not know whether the conjecture is true or false.
      Let us investigate the question further.
      Suppose that <m>n</m> is any positive integer;
      we must ask whether it is possible to factor
      <m>n^2+n+41</m> as a product of two positive integers,
      neither of which is one.<fn>
      Once again we rely on a definition:
      a positive integer is <em>prime</em>
      if it cannot be written as a product of two integers, both greater than one.
      </fn> When <m>n=41</m> such a factorization certainly exists,
      since we can write
      <me>
        41^2+41+41=41(41+1+1)=41\cdot 43
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our <em>counterexample</em> shows that there exists at least one value of <m>n</m> for which
      <m>n^2+n+41</m> is <em>not</em> prime.
      We have therefore disproved the conjecture that <sq>for all positive integers <m>n</m>,
      <m>n^2+n+41</m> is prime,</sq> and so <xref ref="conj_n_2_n_41">Conjecture</xref> is false!
    </p>
    <p>
      <term>The moral of the story is this:
      to show that a conjecture is true you must prove that it holds for all the cases in consideration,
      but to show that it is false a single counterexample suffices.</term>
