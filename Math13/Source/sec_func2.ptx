  <title>Functions revisited</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Now that we have the language of relations,
      we can properly define functions.
      Recall that a function <m>f:A\to B</m> is a rule that assigns one,
      and only one, element of <m>B</m> to each element of <m>A</m>.
      We may therefore view <m>f</m> as a collection of ordered pairs in <m>A\times B</m>:
      <me>
        \big\{(a,f(a)):a\in A\big\}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This set is nothing more than the
      <em>graph</em> of the function,
      and, being a set of ordered pairs, it is a relation.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="defn_func">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\cR\subseteq A\times B</m> be a relation from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m>.
          The <term>domain</term> and <term>range</term>
          of <m>\cR</m> are the sets
          <md>
            <mrow>\dom(\cR)=\{a\in A:(a,b)\in \cR\text{ for some } b\in B\},</mrow>
            <mrow>\range(\cR)=\{b\in B:(a,b)\in \cR\text{ for some } a\in A\}</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <term>function</term> from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m> is a relation
          <m>f\subseteq A\times B</m> satisfying the following conditions:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>\dom(f)=A</m>,
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>(a,b_1),(a,b_2)\in f\implies b_1=b_2</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The two conditions can be thought of as saying:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Every element of <m>A</m> is related to
            <em>at least one</em> element of <m>B</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Every element of <m>A</m> is related to
            <em>at most one</em> element of <m>B</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      Putting these together, we see that a relation
      <m>f\subseteq A\times B</m> is a function if <em>every</em>
      <m>a\in A</m> is the first entry of one
      (and only one)
      ordered pair <m>(a,b)\in f</m>.
      The second condition is the vertical line test, familiar from calculus.
    </p>
    <sidebyside>
      <image width="73%" source="relations-05-funcvert"/>
      <m>b_1=b_2=f(a)</m>: a function
      <image width="73%" source="relations-06-funcvert"/>
      <m>b_1\neq b_2</m>: not a function
    </sidebyside>
    <p>
      We can also think about injectivity and surjectivity
      (recall <xref ref="defn_11">Definition</xref>)
      in this context.
      A function <m>f\subseteq A\times B</m> is:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Injective</em> if no two pairs in <m>f</m> share the same second entry.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Surjective</em> if every <m>b\in B</m> appears as the second entry of at least one pair in <m>f</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Bijective</em> if every <m>b\in B</m> appears as the second entry of one
            (and only one)
            ordered pair <m>(a,b)\in f</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A=B=\{1,2,3\}</m> and consider the relation
        </p>
        <sidebyside>
          <me>
            f=\{(1,3),(2,1),(3,3)\}
          </me>.
          Observe that <m>\dom(f)=\{1,2,3\}=A</m>, and that each element of <m>A</m> appears exactly once as the first element in a pair <m>(a,b)\in f</m>. The relation therefore satisfies both conditions necessary to be a function. In more elementary language we would write <m>f(1)=3</m>,  <m>f(2)=1</m> and <m>f(3)=3</m>.
          Since 3 appears twice as a second entry of an ordered pair in <m>f</m> we see that <m>f</m> is <em>not injective.</em>
          Since 2 never appears as the second entry of an ordered pair in <m>f</m> we see that <m>f</m> is <em>not surjective.</em>

      <statement>
        <p>

          </me>.
        </p>

          Then <m>\id_A</m> is a bijective function

  <subsection>
    <title>The Inverse of a Function</title>
    <p>
      Since every function is a relation,
      it is a straightforward business to define the inverse of a function.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>inverse</term> of a function
          <m>f\subseteq A\times B</m> is the inverse relation <m>f^{-1}\subseteq B\times A</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      To compute an inverse relation we simply reverse the components of each ordered pair:
      the following should therefore be clear.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm_inversedomrange">
      <statement>
        <p>
          <m>\dom(f^{-1})=\range(f)</m> and <m>\range(f^{-1})=\dom(f)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      In general, you should expect the inverse of a function to be merely a relation and not a function in its own right.
      We shall shortly
      (<xref ref="thm_finverse">Theorem</xref>)
      discuss when the inverse relation is a function.
    </p>
    <example>
      <title>cont</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the above example.
        </p>
        <sidebyside>
          The inverse relation
          <me>
            f^{-1}=\{(3,1),(1,2),(3,3)\}\subseteq B\times A
          </me>
          is <em>not</em> a function due to failing <em>both</em> conditions of <xref ref="defn_func">Definition</xref>.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>\dom(f^{-1})=\{1,3\}</m> is not the whole of <m>B</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>(3,1)\in f^{-1}</m> and <m>(3,3)\in f^{-1}</m>, but <m>1\neq 3</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          Both failures are clearly visible in the picture.
          <image width="73%" source="relations-19-reln1"/>
          <m>f^{-1}\subseteq B\times A</m>: not a function
        </sidebyside>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Before we consider exactly when the inverse of a function is a function in its own right,
      we consider a few more examples.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_reln1">
      <statement>
        <p>
          \item Let <m>A=B=\R</m> and <m>f=\{(x,x^2):x\in\R\}</m>.
          This is simply the function with formula <m>f(x)=x^2</m>.
          The inverse relation <m>f^{-1}\subseteq\R\times\R</m> is then
          <me>
            f^{-1}=\bigl\{(x^2,x):x\in\R\bigr\}=\bigl\{(y,\pm\sqrt y):y\ge 0\bigr\}
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this case, <m>f^{-1}</m> is <em>not a function.</em>
          In the language of <xref ref="defn_func">Definition</xref>:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>\dom(f^{-1})=\R^+_0\neq B</m>.
                E.g., <m>-1\in B</m> but <m>-1\not\in\dom(f^{-1})</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>(4,2)</m> and <m>(4,-2)</m> are distinct elements of <m>f^{-1}</m> with the same first entry.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <m>f^{-1}\subseteq B\times A</m>: not a function
        </sidebyside>
        <p>
          It should be obvious that <m>f</m> is neither injective nor surjective:
          in the language of relations,
          <ul>
            <li>
              <title>Not injective</title>

            </li>
            <li>
              <title>Not surjective</title>
              <p>
                <nbsp/><nbsp/> For instance,
                <m>-1</m> never appears as the second entry of any pair in <m>f</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe how these are merely a rewriting of what it means for <m>f^{-1}</m> to fail to be a function.
        </p>
        <p>
          \item Let <m>A=B=\R</m> and <m>f=\{(x,x^3):x\in\R\}</m>,
          so that <m>f</m> has formula <m>f(x)=x^3</m>.
          This time, the inverse is also a function and we could write <m>f^{-1}(y)=\sqrt[3]{y}</m>:
          <me>
            f^{-1}=\bigl\{(x^3,x):x\in\R\bigr\}=\bigl\{(y,\sqrt[3]{y}):y\in\R\bigr\}

          <m>f^{-1}:B\to A</m> is a function
        </sidebyside>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      All three of our examples help to illustrate the following important result.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm_finverse">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A relation <m>f^{-1}\subseteq B\times A</m> is a function <m>\iff f</m> is bijective
          (both injective and surjective).
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Recalling <xref ref="defn_func">Definition</xref>, we see that
        <me>
          f^{-1}\text{ is a function } \iff\begin{cases}\dom(f^{-1})=B,\\ \qquad\textit{{and}}\\ (b,a_1),(b,a_2)\in f^{-1}\implies a_1=a_2. \end{cases}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        The first of these is equivalent to <m>\range(f)=B</m>,
        which says that <m>f</m> is surjective.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second is equivalent to <m>(a_1,b),(a_2,b)\in f\implies a_1=a_2</m>,
        which says that <m>f</m> is injective.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      Here is a final example,
      where the function <m>f</m> is harder to visualize.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A=\R</m>, <m>B=\Q</m> and define <m>f</m> using the formula
          <me>
            f(x)=\begin{cases}x\amp \text{ if } x\in\Q,\\ 0\amp \text{ if } x\not\in\Q. \end{cases}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          In the language of relations,
          this is <m>f=\bigl\{(x,x):x\in\Q\bigr\}\cup\bigl\{(x,0):x\not\in\Q\bigr\}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a surjective function since every element of <m>B=\Q</m> appears as the second entry in an ordered pair <m>(a,b)\in f</m>.
          It is not injective since zero appears more than once in the second entry.
          For example,
          <me>
            (\sqrt 2,0),\ (\sqrt 3,0)\in f
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Written in the more common manner,
          we are observing that <m>f(\sqrt 3)=f(\sqrt 2)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The inverse <m>f^{-1}</m> is not a function,
          and it fails to be so precisely because <m>f</m> is non-injective.
          For example
          <me>
            (0,\sqrt 2)\text{ and }  (0,\sqrt 3)\text{ are distinct elements of \(f^{-1}\) with the same  first component.}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      \paragraph{Inverse Images}
    </p>
    <p>
      Recall that in <xref ref="sec_func1">Section</xref>,
      we can defined the <em>preimage</em>
      of a subset <m>V\subseteq B</m> under a function <m>f:A\to B</m> by
      <me>
        f^{-1}(V)=\{a\in A:f(a)\in V\}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In particular,
      if <m>\{b\}\subseteq B</m> has only one element, then its preimage is
      <me>
        f^{-1}(\{b\})=\{a\in A:f(a)=b\}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both are <em>subsets</em> of <m>A</m>.
      For instance,
      in the last example the preimage of <m>\{0\}</m> consists of zero and all irrational numbers!
      <me>
        f^{-1}(\{0\})=\{0\}\cup(\R\setminus\Q)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      When <m>f^{-1}\subseteq B\times A</m> is a function,
      each preimage of a singleton consists of one point of <m>A</m>:
      thus <m>f^{-1}(\{b\})=\{a\}</m>.
      <em>Only</em> in such a case are we entitled to write <m>f^{-1}(b)=a</m>.[2]
    </p>
    <aside>
      <p>
        <term>Equality of functions</term>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two competing notions of what it means for two functions to be <em>equal.</em>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <title>Same domain, same graph, same codomain</title>
            <p>
              <nbsp/><nbsp/> <m>f=g</m> means that <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are the same subset of the
              <em>same</em> <m>A\times B</m>.
              This notion is preferred by set theorists because it sticks rigidly to the idea that a function is a <em>relation,</em>
              and it requires both the domain <m>A</m> and codomain <m>B</m> to be explicit.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title>Same domain, same graph</title>
            <p>
              <nbsp/><nbsp/> <m>f=g</m> means that <m>f\subseteq A\times B</m>,
              <m>g\subseteq A\times C</m>, and
              <me>
                (a,b)\in f\iff (a,b)\in g
              </me>.
              This notion considers what a function
              <em>does</em> to be fundamental;
              if two functions do the same thing to elements of the same domain then they are the same.
              This looser notion of equality is used more often,
              especially in elementary calculus.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The second conception of equality,
        while intuitive, has a problem.
        For example, let
        <me>
          f:\R\to\R,\text{ and }  g:\R\to[-1,1]\text{ satisfy }  f(x)=g(x)=\sin x
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> have the same graph,
        the different codomains of <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> mean that these are
        <em>different functions</em>
        with respect to the first notion.
        Under the second notion,
        they are the <em>same function.</em> However,
        <m>g</m> is surjective while <m>f</m> is not,
        so wouldn't we prefer <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> to be non-equal?<fn>
        In elementary calculus,
        we usually say that a function is invertible if it is 1<ndash/>1.
        In order for this to make sense,
        we have to ignore surjectivity and use the second notion of functional equality.

        The same problem does not arise when considering domains.
        For example,
        in calculus you might have compared functions such as
        <me>
          f(x)=x^2+2,\text{ and }  g(x)=\frac{(x^2+2)(x-1)}{x-1}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The implied domains of these functions are
        <m>\dom(f)=\R</m> and <m>\dom(g)=\R\setminus\{1\}</m>.
        Even though these have the same graph whenever
        <em>both</em> are defined,
        regardless of which notion you choose we have <m>f\neq g</m>,
        since the functions have <em>different domains.</em>
