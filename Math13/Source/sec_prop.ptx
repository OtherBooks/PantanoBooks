          A <term>proposition</term> or <term>statement</term>
          is an expression that is either true or false.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          \item <m>17-24=7</m>. \item <m>39^2</m> is an odd integer. \item The moon is made of cheese. \item Every cloud has a silver lining. \item God exists.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      In order to make sense,
      these propositions require a clear <em>definition</em>
      of every concept they contain.
      There are many concepts of God in many cultures,
      but once it is decided <em>which</em> we are talking about,
      it is clear that They either exist or do not.
      This example illustrates that a statement need not be indisputably true or false,
      or even determinable, in order to qualify as a proposition.
      Mostly when people argue over propositions and statements,
      what they are really disagreeing about are definitions!
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that any expression that is neither true nor false is not a proposition.
      <em>January 1<m>^{\text{ st } }</m></em> is not a proposition,
      neither is <em>Green.</em>

    <title>Truth Tables</title>
    <p>
      One often has to deal with abstract propositions;
      those where you do not know the truth or falsity,
      or indeed when you don't explicitly know the proposition!
      In such cases it can be convenient to represent the combinations of propositions in a tabular format.
      For instance,
      if we have two propositions (<m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>),
      or even three (<m>P,Q</m> and <m>R</m>) then all possible combinations of truth <m>T</m> and falsehood <m>F</m> are represented in the following tables:
      <me>
        \begin{array}{cc} P \amp  Q\\\hline T \amp  T\\ T \amp  F\\ F \amp  T\\ F \amp  F\\ \amp \\\amp \\\amp \\\amp \end{array} \qquad\qquad\qquad \begin{array}{ccc} P \amp  Q \amp  R\\\hline T \amp  T \amp  T\\ T \amp  T \amp  F\\ T \amp  F \amp  T\\ T \amp  F \amp  F\\ F \amp  T \amp  T\\ F \amp  T \amp  F\\ F \amp  F \amp  T\\ F \amp  F \amp  F \end{array}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The mathematician in you should be looking for patterns and asking:
      how many rows would a truth table corresponding to <m>n</m> propositions have,
      and can I <em>prove</em> my assertion?
      Right now it is hard to prove that the answer is <m>2^n</m>:
      induction (<xref ref="sec_ind">Chapter</xref>) makes this very easy.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Connecting Propositions: Conjunction, Disjunction and Negation</title>
    <p>
      We now <em>define</em> how to combine propositions in natural ways,
      modeled on the words <em>and, or</em> and <em>not.</em>
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> be propositions.
          The <term>conjunction</term> (AND, <m>\wedge</m>) of <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>,
          the <term>disjunction</term> (OR, <m>\vee</m>) of <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>,
          and the <term>negation</term> (NOT, <m>\neg</m>, <m>\sim</m>,
          <m>\cl{}</m>) of <m>P</m> are defined by the following truth tables,
          <me>
            \begin{array}{cc|c} P \amp  Q \amp  P\wedge Q\\\hline T \amp  T \amp  T\\ T \amp  F \amp  F\\ F \amp  T \amp  F\\ F \amp  F \amp  F \end{array} \qquad\qquad \begin{array}{cc|c} P \amp  Q \amp  P\vee Q\\\hline T \amp  T \amp  T\\ T \amp  F \amp  T\\ F \amp  T \amp  T\\ F \amp  F \amp  F \end{array} \qquad\qquad \begin{array}{c|c} P \amp  \neg P\\\hline T \amp  F\\ F \amp  T \end{array}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      It is usually better to use <em>and,
      or</em> and <em>not</em> rather than <em>conjunction,
      disjunction</em> and <em>negation</em>:
      the latter may make you sound educated,
      but at the risk of being misunderstood!
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>P,Q</m> and <m>R</m> be the following propositions:
          <ul>
            \itemstart{<m>P</m>.} Irvine is a city in California. \itemstart{<m>Q</m>.} Irvine is a town in Ayrshire, Scotland. \itemstart{<m>R</m>.} Irvine has seven letters.
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Clearly <m>P</m> is true while <m>R</m> is false.
          If you happen to know someone from Scotland,
          you might know that <m>Q</m> is true.<fn>
          The second syllable is pronounced like the i in bin or win.
          Indeed the first Californian antecedent of the Irvine family which gave its name to UCI was an Ulster-Scotsman named James Irvine (1827<ndash/>1886).
          Probably the family name was originally pronounced in the Scottish manner.
          </fn> We can now compute the following
          (increasingly grotesque)
          combinations<ellipsis/>
          <me>
            \begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c} P\wedge Q\amp P\vee Q\amp P\wedge R\amp \neg R\amp (\neg R)\wedge P\amp \neg(R\vee P)\amp (\neg P)\vee [((\neg R)\vee P)\wedge Q] \\\hline T \amp  T \amp  F \amp  T \amp  T \amp  F \amp  T \end{array}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      How did we establish these facts?
      Some are quick, and can be done in your head.
      Consider, for instance, the statement <m>(\neg R)\wedge P</m>.
      Because <m>R</m> is false, <m>\neg R</m> is true.
      Thus <m>(\neg R)\wedge P</m> is the conjunction of two true statements,
      hence it is true.
      Similarly, we can argue that <m>R\vee P</m> is true
      (because <m>R</m> is false and <m>P</m> is true),
      so the negation <m>\neg(R\vee P)</m> is false.
    </p>
    <p>
      Establishing the truth value of the final proposition <m>(\neg P)\vee [((\neg R)\vee P) \wedge Q]</m> requires more work.
      You may want to set up a truth table with several auxiliary columns to help you compute:
      <me>
        \begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c} P \amp  Q \amp  R \amp  \neg P \amp  \neg R \amp  (\neg R) \vee P \amp  ((\neg R)\vee P) \wedge Q \amp   (\neg P) \vee [ ((\neg R)\vee P) \wedge Q] \\\hline T \amp  T \amp  F \amp  F            \amp  T         \amp  T                        \amp  T                                               \amp  T \end{array}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The importance of parentheses in a logical expressions cannot be stressed enough.
      For example, try building the truth table for the propositions
      <m>P\vee(Q\wedge R)</m> and <m>(P\vee Q)\wedge R</m>.
      Are they the same?
    </p>

    <title>Conditional and Biconditional Connectives</title>
    <p>
      In order to logically set up proofs,
      we need to see how propositions can lead one to another.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="defn_implies">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>conditional</term> (<m>\implies</m>) and
          <term>biconditional</term>
          (<m>\iff</m>) <em>connectives</em> have the truth tables
          <me>
            \begin{array}{cc|c} P \amp  Q \amp  P\implies Q\\\hline T \amp  T \amp  T\\ T \amp  F \amp  F\\ F \amp  T \amp  T\\ F \amp  F \amp  T \end{array} \qquad\qquad\qquad \begin{array}{cc|c} P \amp  Q \amp  P\iff Q\\\hline T \amp  T \amp  T\\ T \amp  F \amp  F\\ F \amp  T \amp  F\\ F \amp  F \amp  T \end{array}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          For the proposition <m>\timplies P{Q,}</m> we call <m>P</m> the <term>hypothesis</term>
          and <m>Q</m> the <term>conclusion</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Observe that the expressions <m>\timplies PQ</m> and
      <m>\ P\iff Q\</m> are themselves <em>propositions</em>:
      they are sentences which are either true or false!

      Are you comfortable with what <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are here?
    </p>
    <p>
      The biconditional connective should be easy to remember:
      <m>\ P\iff Q\</m> is true precisely when <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> have identical truth states.
      It is harder to make sense of the conditional connective.
      One way of thinking about it is to consider what it means for an implication to be <em>false.</em>
      If <m>P\implies Q</m> is false,
      it is impossible to create a logical argument which assumes <m>P</m> and concludes <m>Q</m>.
      The second row of <m>\timplies PQ</m> encapsulates the fact that it should be impossible for truth ever to logically imply falsehood.
    </p>
    <aside>
      <p>
        <term>Why is <m>F\implies T</m> considered <em>true?</em></term>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the most immediately confusing part of the truth table for the conditional connective.
        One way that may help to remember this is to think of the implication <m>P \implies Q</m> as making a promise.
        For example, suppose your teacher says:
        <q>if the class earns a B average on the midterm exam,
        then I will buy donuts for the class.</q>
        Under what circumstances will your teacher have lied to you?
        Only in the case that it is true that the class earned a B average,
        but the teacher failed to provide donuts for the class.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is a mathematical example,
        written with an English translation at the side.
        <md>
          <mrow>7=3\implies\ \amp 0\cdot 7=0\cdot 3\tag{(If 7 = 3, then 0 times 7 equals 0 times 3)}</mrow>
          <mrow>\implies\ \amp 0=0\tag{(then 0 equals 0)}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus <m>7=3\implies 0=0</m>.
        Logically speaking this is a perfectly correct argument,
        thus the <em>implication</em> is true.
        The argument makes us uncomfortable because <m>7=3</m> is clearly false.

    <title>Theorems and Direct Proofs</title>
    <p>
      Truth tables and connectives are very abstract.
      To apply them to mathematics we need the following basic notions of theorem and proof.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>theorem</term> is a justified assertion that some statement of the form <m>\timplies PQ</m> is true.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <term>proof</term> is an argument that justifies the truth of a theorem.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Think back to the truth table for
      <m>\timplies PQ</m> in <xref ref="defn_implies">Definition</xref>.
      Suppose that the hypothesis <m>P</m> is true and that <m>\timplies PQ</m> is true:
      that is, <m>\timplies PQ</m> is a <em>theorem.</em>
      We must be in the <em>first row</em> of the truth table,
      and so the conclusion <m>Q</m> is also true.
      This is how we think about proving basic theorems.
      In a <em>direct proof</em> we start by assuming the hypothesis (<m>P</m>) is true and make a logical argument (<m>P\implies Q</m>) which asserts that the conclusion (<m>Q</m>) is true.
      As such, it often convenient to rewrite the statement of a theorem as an implication of the form
      <m>\timplies P{Q.}</m> Here is a very simple theorem which we prove directly.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The product of two odd integers is odd.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      The first thing to do is to write the theorem in terms of propositions and connectives:
      that is, in the form <m>P\implies Q</m>.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>P</m> is <sq><m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are odd integers.</sq> This is our assumption,
            the hypothesis.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>Q</m> is <sq>The product of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> is odd.</sq> This is what we want to show,
            the conclusion.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Showing that <m>\timplies PQ</m> is true, that
            (the truth of)
            <m>P</m> implies
            (the truth of)
            <m>Q</m> requires an argument.
            This is the <em>proof.</em>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> be <em>any</em> two odd integers.
        We want to show that product <m>x\cdot y</m> is an odd integer.
      </p>
      <p>
        By definition,
        an integer is odd if it can be written in the form <m>2k+1</m> for
        <em>some</em> integer <m>k</m>.
        Thus there must be integers <m>n</m>,
        <m>m</m> such that <m>x=2n+1</m> and <m>y=2m+1</m>.
        We compute:
        <me>
          x\cdot y=(2n+1)(2m+1)=4mn+2n+2m+1=2(2mn+n+m)+1
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because <m>2mn+n+m</m> is an integer,
        this shows that <m>x\cdot y</m> is an odd integer.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      It is common to place a symbol
      (in this case \smash{<m>\qedsymbol</m>})
      at the end of a proof to tell the reader that your argument is complete.
      Traditionally the letters Q.E.D.
      (from the Latin <em>quod erat demonstrandum,</em>
      literally <sq>which is what had to be demonstrated</sq>)
      were used, but this has gone out of style.You may also feel that you want to write more,
      or less than the above.
      This is a difficult thing to judge.
      What do you feel is a convincing argument?
      Test your argument on your classmates.
      The appropriate level of detail will depend on your readership:
      a middle school student will need more detail than a graduate student!
      At the moment,
      the best guide is to write for someone with the same mathematical sophistication as yourself.
      If, in three weeks' time,
      you can return to what you've written and understand it,
      then it's probably good!

    <title>The Converse and Contrapositive</title>
    <p>
      The following constructions are used continually in mathematics:
      it is vitally important to know the difference between them.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="defn_contra">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>converse</term> of an implication
          <m>\timplies PQ</m> is the reversed implication <m>\timplies Q{P.}</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          The <term>contrapositive</term> of
          <m>\timplies PQ</m> is <m>\timplies{\neg Q}{\neg P.}</m>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      In general, we cannot say anything about the truth value of the converse of a true implication.
      The contrapositive of a true implication is,
      however, <em>always</em> true.
      Actually, even more is true,
      an implication and its contrapositive always have the same truth value.
      This is a common enough phenomenon that we give it its own name.

      This definition is a bit vague

        <p>
          The contrapositive of an implication is logically equivalent the original implication.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Simply use our definitions of negation and implication to compute the truth table:
        <md>
          <mrow>\begin{array}{cc|c||cc|c} P \amp  Q \amp  P\implies Q \amp  \neg Q \amp  \neg P \amp  \neg Q\implies\neg P\\\hline T \amp  T \amp  \mathbf T \amp  F \amp  F \amp  \mathbf T\\ T \amp  F \amp  \mathbf F \amp  T \amp  F \amp  \mathbf F\\ F \amp  T \amp  \mathbf T \amp  F \amp  T \amp  \mathbf T\\ F \amp  F \amp  \mathbf T \amp  T \amp  T \amp  \mathbf T \end{array}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the truth states in the third and sixth columns
        (in bold)
        are identical, we see that
        <m>\timplies PQ</m> and its contrapositive
        <m>\timplies{\neg Q}{\neg P}</m> are logically equivalent.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> be the following statements:
          <ul>
            \itemstart{<m>P</m>.} Claudia is holding a peach. \itemstart{<m>Q</m>.} Claudia is holding a piece of fruit.
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          The implication <m>P\implies Q</m> is true,
          since all peaches are fruit.
          As a sentence, we have:
          <ul>
            <li class="custom-list-style-type">
              <p>
                If Claudia is holding a peach,
                then Claudia is holding a piece of fruit.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          The <em>converse</em> of <m>P\implies Q</m> is the sentence:
          <ul>
            <li class="custom-list-style-type">
              <p>
                If Claudia is holding a piece of fruit,
                then Claudia is holding a peach.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          This is palpably false: Claudia could be holding an apple!
        </p>
        <p>
          The <em>contrapositive</em> of
          <m>P\implies Q</m> is the following sentence:
          <ul>
            <li class="custom-list-style-type">
              <p>
                If Claudia is <em>not</em> holding any fruit,
                then she is <em>not</em> holding a peach.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          This is clearly true.

    <title>Proof by Contrapositive</title>
    <p>
      The fact that <m>\timplies PQ</m> and
      <m>\timplies{\neg Q}{\neg P}</m> are logically equivalent allows us,
      when convenient,
      to prove <m>\timplies PQ</m> by instead proving its contrapositive.
      As an example, consider another basic theorem.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> be integers.
          If <m>x+y</m> is odd, then exactly one of <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> is odd.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      The theorem is an implication of the form <m>\timplies PQ</m> where
      <ul>
        \itemstart{<m>P</m>.} The sum <m>x+y</m> of integers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> is odd. \itemstart{<m>Q</m>.} Exactly one of <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> is odd.
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      A direct proof would require that we assume <m>P</m> to be true and logically deduce the truth of <m>Q</m>.
      For instance we might start our argument with:
      <me>
        \text{ Suppose that \(x+y=2n+1\) for some integer \(n\) }
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The problem is that this doesn't really tell us anything about <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>,
      which we need to think about in order to demonstrate the truth of <m>Q</m>.
      Instead we consider the negations of our propositions:
      <ul>
        \itemstart{<m>\neg Q</m>.}<nbsp/><nbsp/> <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are both even or both odd (they have the same parity). \itemstart{<m>\neg P</m>.}<nbsp/><nbsp/> The sum <m>x+y</m> of integers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> is even.
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Since <m>\timplies PQ</m> is logically equivalent to the seemingly simpler contrapositive
      <m>\timplies{(\neg Q)}{(\neg P),}</m> we choose to prove the latter.
      This is, by <xref ref="thm_contrapos">Theorem</xref>,
      equivalent to proving the original implication.
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Assume that <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> have the same parity.
        There are two cases: <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are both even,
        or both odd.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <title>Case 1:</title>
            <p>
              Let <m>x=2m</m> and <m>y=2n</m> be even.
              Then <m>x+y=2(m+n)</m> is even.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title>Case 2:</title>
            <p>
              Let <m>x=2m+1</m> and <m>y=2n+1</m> be odd.
              Then <m>x+y=2(m+n+1)</m> is even.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        In both cases <m>x+y</m> is even, and the result is proved.

    <title>De Morgan's Laws</title>
    <p>
      In order to perform proofs by contrapositive
      (and later by contradiction)
      it is necessary to compute the negations of propositions.
      The most helpful results in this regard are attributable to Augustus de Morgan,
      a very famous 19th century logician.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm_demorgan">
      <title>de Morgan's laws</title>
      <statement>
        <p>

              <p>
                <m>\neg(P\wedge Q)</m> is logically equivalent to <m>\neg P\vee\neg Q</m>.

            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>

    <p>
      Here is a proof of the first law.

      <p>
        Simply observe that the fourth and seventh columns are identical.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      It is worth pausing to observe how similar the two laws are,
      and how concise.
      There is some beauty here.
      With a written example the laws are much easier to comprehend.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          (Of the first law) Suppose that of a morning you can choose
          (or not)
          to ride the subway to work, and you can choose
          (or not)
          to have a cup of coffee.
          Consider the following sentence:
          <ul>
            <li class="custom-list-style-type">
              <p>
                I rode the subway <em>and</em> I had coffee.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          What would it mean for this sentence to be <em>false?</em>
          Any sentence which asserts the falsehood of the above is a suitable
          <em>negation.</em> For example:
          <ul>
            <li class="custom-list-style-type">
              <p>
                I <em>didn't</em> ride the subway <em>or</em>
                I <em>didn't</em> have coffee.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that the mathematical use of <em>or</em>
          includes the possibility that you neither rode the subway nor had coffee.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      You will see de Morgan's laws again when we encounter sets.
    </p>
    <aside>
      <p>
        <term>Think about the meaning!</term>
      </p>
      <p>
        In the previous example we saw how negation switches
        <em>and</em> to <em>or.</em>
        This is true only when <em>and</em>
        denotes a conjunction between two propositions.
        Before applying De Morgan's laws,
        think about the <em>meaning</em> of the sentence.
        For example, the negation of
        <ul>
          <li class="custom-list-style-type">
            <p>
              Mark and Mary have the same height.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        is the proposition:
        <ul>
          <li class="custom-list-style-type">
            <p>
              Mark and Mary do not have the same height.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you blindly appeal to De Morgan's laws you might end up with the following piece of nonsense:
        <ul>
          <li class="custom-list-style-type">
            <p>
              Mark <em>or</em> Mary do not have the same height.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Logical rules are wonderfully concise, but very easy to misuse.
        Always think about the meaning of a sentence and you shouldn't go wrong.

    <title>Negating Conditionals</title>
    <p>
      You will often want to understand the negation of a statement.
      In particular,
      it is important to understand the negation of a conditional
      <m>\timplies P{Q.}</m> Is it enough to say <sq><m>P</m> doesn</sq>t imply <m>Q</m>'? And what could this mean?
      To answer the question you can use truth tables, or just think.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is the truth table for <m>\timplies PQ</m> and its negation:
      recall that negation simply swaps <m>T</m> and <m>F</m>.
      <me>
        \begin{array}{cc|c|c} P \amp  Q \amp  P\implies Q \amp  \neg(P\implies Q)\\\hline T \amp  T \amp  T \amp  F\\ T \amp  F \amp  F \amp  T\\ F \amp  T \amp  T \amp  F\\ F \amp  F \amp  T \amp  F \end{array}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The only time there is a <m>T</m> in the final column is when <em>both</em>
      <m>P</m> is true <em>and</em> <m>Q</m> is false.
      We have therefore proved the following:
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm_negconditional">
      <statement>
        <p>
          <m>\neg(P\implies Q)</m> is logically equivalent to <m>P\wedge\neg Q</m>
          (read <sq><m>P</m> and not <m>Q</m></sq>).
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      Now <em>think</em> in words rather than calculate.
      What is the negation of the following implication?
      <ul>
        <li class="custom-list-style-type">
          <p>
            It's the morning therefore I'll have coffee.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopefully it is clear that the negation is:
      <ul>
        <li class="custom-list-style-type">
          <p>
            It's the morning <em>and</em> I
            <em>won't</em> have coffee.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The implication <em><sq>therefore</sq></em>
      has disappeared and the expression
      <em><sq>and won</sq>t'</em> is in its place.
    </p>
    <p>
      <term>Warning!</term> The negation of <m>\timplies PQ</m> is
      <em>not a conditional.</em>
      In particular it is <em>neither</em> of the following:
      <ul>
        <li class="custom-list-style-type">
          <p>
            The converse, <m>Q\implies P</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="custom-list-style-type">
          <p>
            The contrapositive of the converse,
            <m>\neg P\implies\neg Q</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are unsure about this,
      write down the truth tables and compare.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>x</m> be an integer.
          What is the negation of the following sentence?
          <ul>
            <li class="custom-list-style-type">
              <p>
                If <m>x</m> is even, then <m>x^2</m> is even.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Written in terms of propositions,
          we wish to negate <m>\timplies PQ</m>,
          where <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are:
          <ul>
            \itemstart{<m>P</m>.} <m>x</m> is even. \itemstart{<m>Q</m>.} <m>x^2</m> is even.
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          The negation of <m>P\implies Q</m> is <m>P\wedge\neg Q</m>, namely:
          <ul>
            <li class="custom-list-style-type">
              <p>
                <m>x</m> is even and <m>x^2</m> is odd.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          This is very different to <m>\timplies{\neg P}{\neg Q}</m>
          (if <m>x</m> is odd then <m>x^2</m> is odd).
        </p>
        <p>
          Keep yourself straight by thinking about the meaning of these sentences.
          It should be obvious that <sq><m>x</m> even <m>\implies x^2</m> even</sq> is true.
          It negation should therefore be <em>false.</em>
          The fact that it is false should make reading the negation feel a little uncomfortable.

    <title>Tautologies and Contradictions</title>
    <p>
      We finish this section with two related concepts that are helpful for understanding proofs.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>tautology</term> is a logical expression that is always true,
          regardless of what the component statements might be.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <term>contradiction</term> is a logical expression that is always false.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The easiest way to detect these is simply to construct a truth table.
      We remark that two propositions <m>\varphi</m> and <m>\psi</m> are logically equivalent if and only if <m>\varphi \iff \psi</m> is a tautology.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          \item <m>P\wedge(\neg P)</m> is a very simple contradiction:

            \begin{array}{cc|c} P \amp  \neg P \amp  P\wedge(\neg P)\\\hline T \amp  F \amp  F\\ F \amp  T \amp  F \end{array}
          </me>
        </p>

          Whatever the proposition <m>P</m> is,
          it cannot be true at the same time as its negation. \item <m>(P\wedge(P\implies Q))\implies Q</m>  is a tautology.
          This is essentially how we understand a direct proof:
          if <m>P</m> is true and we have a correct argument <m>P\implies Q</m>,
          then <m>Q</m> must also be true.

        One can study logic in a more algebraic manner.
        De Morgan's Laws are algebraic.
        Here are a few of the other basic laws of logic.

        You can check them all with truth tables.
        Using these rules, one can answer questions,
        such as deciding when an expression is a tautology,
        without laboriously creating truth tables.
        It is even fun!
        Such an approach is appropriate when you are considering abstract propositions,
        say in a formal logic course.
        In this text our primary interest with logic lies in using it to prove theorems.
        When one has an explicit theorem it is important to keep the meanings of all propositions clear.
        By relying too much on abstract laws like the above,
        it is easy to lose the meaning and write nonsense!

                and the connective <m>\downarrow</m> which is logically equivalent to <m>P \land Q</m>.
                <hint>
                  <p>
                    do the problem for <m>P \lor Q</m> first,
                    then use De Morgan's laws.
                  </p>

          (Hard) Suppose that <m>P,Q</m> are propositions.
          Argue that <em>any</em> of the 16 possible truth tables
          <me>
            \begin{array}{cc|c} P\amp Q\amp ?\\\hline T\amp T \amp  T/F\\ T\amp F \amp  T/F\\ F\amp T \amp  T/F\\ F\amp F \amp  T/F \end{array}
          </me>
          represents an expression ? created using only <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> and the operations <m>\wedge,\vee,\neg</m>.
          Can you extend your argument to show that any truth table with any number of inputs represents some logical expression?
