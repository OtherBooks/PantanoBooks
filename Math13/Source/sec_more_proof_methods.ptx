    <title>Definition-Pushing</title>
    <p>
      The next example concerns divisibility.
      Before you can prove a theorem,
      it is critical that you know the <em>meaning</em>
      of all of the words in its statement.
      We therefore state the definition of divisibility.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>n</m> and <m>p</m> be integers.
          We say that <m>n</m> is <term>divisible by</term> <m>p</m>
          (or <m>p</m> <term>divides</term> <m>n</m>)
          if <m>n = pk</m> for some integer <m>k</m>.
          If <m>n</m> is divisible by <m>p</m>, we write <m>p \mid n</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Now we can present a theorem.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>n\in\Z</m> is divisible by <m>p\in\N</m>,
          then <m>n^2</m> is divisible by <m>p^2</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We prove directly.
        Let <m>n</m> be divisible by <m>p</m>.
        Then <m>n=pk</m> for some <m>k\in\Z</m>.
        Then <m>n^2=p^2k^2</m>, and so <m>n^2</m> is divisible by <m>p^2</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      This is an example of a <em>definition-pushing</em> proof.
      If you simply state the the definition of everything important in the theorem,
      the proof will often be staring you in the face.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Proof by Cases</title>
    <p>
      The next proof is also in the definition-pushing vein.
      However, it requires that we consider several cases.
      The relevant definition here is that of <em>remainder.</em>
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          An integer <m>n</m> is said to have remainder <m>r=0,1</m>,
          or 2 upon division by 3 if we can write <m>n=3k+r</m> for some integer <m>k</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      With a little thought,
      it should be clear that every integer is of the form <m>3k</m>,
      <m>3k+1</m> or <m>3k+2</m>.
      This is analogous to how all integers are either even (<m>2k</m>) or odd <m>(2k+1)</m>.
      We will consider remainders more carefully in <xref ref="sec_gcd">Chapter</xref>.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm_sqmod3">
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>n</m> is an integer,
          then <m>n^2</m> has remainder 0 or 1 upon dividing by 3.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We again prove directly.
        There are three cases:
        <m>n</m> has remainder 0, 1 or 2 upon dividing by 3.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <title>(a)</title>
            <p>
              If <m>n</m> has remainder 0, then <m>n=3m</m> for some <m>m\in\Z</m> and so <m>n^2=9m^2=3(3m^2)</m> has remainder 0.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title>(b)</title>
            <p>
              If <m>n</m> has remainder 1, then <m>n=3m+1</m> for some <m>m\in\Z</m> and so
              <me>
                n^2=9m^2+6m+1=3(3m^2+2m)+1\text{ has remainder 1. }
              </me>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title>(c)</title>
            <p>
              If <m>n</m> has remainder 2, then <m>n=3m+2</m> for some <m>m\in\Z</m> and so
              <me>
                n^2=9m^2+12m+4=3(3m^2+4m+1)+1\text{ has remainder 1. }
              </me>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus <m>n^2</m> has remainder 0 or 1.
      </p>
    </proof>

    <title>Proving Universal Statements</title>
    <p>
      You have already seen many examples of proving universal statements in <xref ref="sec_proof">Section</xref>,
      albeit where the universal quantifier was hidden.
      For example,
      <xref ref="thm__x_odd_if_3x_5_is_odd">Theorem</xref>
      could be written explicitly with the universal quantifier:
      <m>\forall x \in \Z</m>, if <m>x</m> is odd,
      then <m>3x + 5</m> is odd.
      Proving this version with the explicit universal quantifier would go much the same way as with the version with the hidden quantifier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes theorems are not written explicitly in the form <m>\forall x \, (P(x) \implies Q(x))</m>.
      Here is one example, called the
      <em>Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean Inequality</em>,
      or <em>AM-GM</em> for short.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm_amgm">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For all positive real numbers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, we have
          <me>
            \frac{x+y}{2}\ge\sqrt{xy}
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      This theorem is written in the form
      <m>\forall x, y > 0, \, P(x,y)</m> where <m>P(x,y)</m> is the statement <m>\frac{x + y}{2} \geq \sqrt{xy}</m>.
      It may seem unclear how to approach proving such a theorem as our proof methods so far have mostly focused on proving
      <em>conditional</em> statements.
      So one way to start would be to rewrite this theorem as a conditional.
      From <xref ref="sec_quant">Section</xref>,
      we know that <m>\forall x,y > 0, \, P(x,y)</m> is equivalent to <m>\forall x,y \, ((x > 0 \land y > 0) \implies P(x,y))</m>.
      So we are essentially proving:
      <me>
        \text{If \(x,y>0\), then \(\frac{x+y}{2}\ge\sqrt{xy}\).}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      First we give a direct proof:
      note how the implication signs are stacked to make the argument clearer.
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Clearly <m>(x-y)^2\ge 0</m> with equality if and only if <m>x=y</m>.
        Now multiply out:
        <md>
          <mrow>x^2-2xy+y^2\ge 0\amp \iff (x^2+2xy+y^2)- 4xy  \ge 0</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp \iff x^2+2xy+y^2\ge 4xy</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp \iff (x+y)^2\ge 4xy</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp \iff x+y\ge 2\sqrt{xy}\tag{($\ast$)}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp \iff \frac{x+y}{2}\ge \sqrt{xy}</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The square-root in <m>(\ast)</m> is well-defined because <m>x+y</m> is positive,
        which is true because we assumed <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are positive.<fn>
        Moreover, the inequality is preserved since the function
        <m>f(t)=t^2</m> is <em>increasing</em>
        when <m>t</m> is positive.
        </fn>
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      The following contradiction proof incorporates exactly the same calculation,
      but is laid out in a different order.
      This is not always possible, and you have to take great care when trying it.
      You will likely agree that the direct proof is easier to follow.
      Note that for contradiction we assume that
      <me>
        \neg \forall x,y > 0, \, \frac{x + y}{2} \geq \sqrt{xy}
      </me>
      is true.
      Pushing the negation through,
      our contradiction assumption becomes
      <me>
        \exists x,y > 0, \, \frac{x + y}{2} \lt  \sqrt{xy}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>\frac{x+y}{2}\lt \sqrt{xy}</m> for some <m>x,y > 0</m>.
        Since <m>x+y\ge 0</m>, this is true if and only if <m>(x+y)^2\lt 4xy</m>.
        Now multiply out and rearrange:
        <md>
          <mrow>(x+y)^2\lt 4xy\amp \iff x^2+2xy+y^2\lt 4xy</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp \iff x^2-2xy+y^2\lt 0</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp \iff (x-y)^2\lt 0</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since squares of real numbers are non-negative, this is a contradiction.
        Thus <m>\frac{x+y}{2}\ge \sqrt{xy}</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>

  <subsection>
    <title>Proving Existential Statements</title>
    <p>
      Now we look at proving existential statements of the form <m>\exists x \, P(x)</m>.
      The most simple approach is to come up with some object <m>x_0</m> such that <m>P(x_0)</m> is true.
      Such an <m>x_0</m> is called an <em>example</em>
      or <em>witness</em> of <m>P(x)</m>.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> be two fixed integers with <m>m \lt n</m>.
          Then there exists a rational number <m>r</m> such that <m>m \lt r \lt n</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>r = \frac{m + n}{2}</m> be the arithmetic mean of <m>m</m> and <m>n</m>.
        Then <m>r</m> is a rational number as it is of the form <m>p/q</m> for an integer <m>p</m> and nonzero integer <m>q</m>.
        Since <m>m \lt n</m>, we have
        <m>2m \lt m + n \lt 2n</m> and dividing by <m>2</m> yields <m>m \lt r \lt n</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      This is an example of a <em>constructive</em>
      proof as we explicitly construct the number which makes the proposition true.
      Later we will we give an example of a
      <em>non-constructive</em>
      proof of an existential statement where we show that an example must exist,
      even though we do not know what it is explicitly.
    </p>

    <title>Disproving Universal Statements</title>
    <p>
      What does it take to show that some universal statement is false?
      If a statement has the form <m>\forall x\, P(x)</m>,
      then by <xref ref="thm_negquant">Theorem</xref>,
      its negation is <m>\exists x\, \neg P(x)</m>.
      In other words, <em>dis</em>proving the universal statement
      <m>\forall x\, P(x)</m> is the same as <em>proving</em>
      the existential statement <m>\exists x\, \neg P(x)</m>.
      This amounts to providing a <em>counterexample</em>,
      i.e., finding some <m>x_0</m> such that <m>P(x_0)</m> is false.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Disprove the following statement.
          If all four sides of a quadrilateral have the same length,
          then the quadrilateral must be a square.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <proof>
      <p>
        All four sides of a square certainly have the same length,
        but remember that all four angles in a square must be congruent as well.
        Disproving this statement then amounts to finding some quadrilateral with four congruent sides,
        but without four congruent angles.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can easily construct such a figure in the following way.
        Start with any non-right isosceles triangle <m>\triangle ABC</m> where the sides
        <m>\overline{AB}</m> and <m>\overline{AC}</m> are congruent.
        Now place an identical copy of <m>\triangle ABC</m>,
        call it <m>\triangle A'B'C'</m>,
        on top of <m>\triangle ABC</m> and reflect it through the side <m>\overline{BC}</m>.
        We're left with the quadrilateral <m>ABA'C</m>.
        The sides <m>\overline{AB}</m> and
        <m>\overline{AC}</m> are congruent to each other since we started with an isosceles triangle,
        and these are both congruent to <m>\overline{BA'}</m> and
        <m>\overline{A'C}</m> since these were obtained by copying
        <m>\overline{AB}</m> and <m>\overline{AC}</m>.
        Finally, this figure is <em>not</em>
        a square because angle <m>\angle BAC</m> not a right angle.
        You might remember this figure as a <em>rhombus</em>.

    <title>Disproving Existential Statements: Non-existence Proofs</title>
    <p>
      When a theorem claims that something does not exist,
      it is generally a good idea to try a contrapositive or a contradiction proof.
      This is since <sq>does not exist</sq> is already a
      <em>negative</em> statement.
      A contradiction or contrapositive proof of a theorem
      <m>\timplies PQ</m> already involves the negated statement <m>\neg Q</m>.
      If <m>Q</m> states that something does not exist,
      then <m>\neg Q</m> states that it does,
      which often gives you something to play with!
      To see this in action, consider the following result.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The equation <m>x^{17}+12x^3+13x+3=0</m> has no positive
          (real number)
          solutions.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      First we interpret the theorem as an implication:
      throughout we assume that <m>x</m> is a real number.
      <me>
        \text{For all \(x\), if \(x^{17}+12x^3+13x+3=0\), then \(x\leq 0\).}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The theorem is now in the form <m>\forall x (\timplies{P(x)}{Q(x)})</m>, with:
      <me>
        P(x): x^{17}+12x^3+13x+3=0,\qquad\qquad\qquad Q(x): x\le 0
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The negation of <m>Q(x)</m> is simply <sq><m>x>0</m>.</sq> To prove the theorem by contradiction,
      we assume <m>\exists x \, (P(x) \land \neg Q(x))</m>,
      and deduce a contradiction.
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Assume that a real number <m>x</m> satisfies
        <m>x^{17}+12x^3+13x+3=0</m>, and that <m>x>0</m>.
        Because all terms on the left hand side are positive,
        we have <m>x^{17}+12x^3+13x+3>0</m>.
        A contradiction.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      Note how quickly the proof is written:
      it assumes that any reader is familiar with the underlying logic of a contradiction proof without it needing to be spelled out.
      The discussion we undertook before writing the proof would be considered scratch work:
      you shouldn't include it a final write-up.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to extend the above result,
      and you can recall the Intermediate and Mean Value Theorems from Calculus,
      you should be able to prove that there is exactly one
      (necessarily negative!)
      solution to the above polynomial equation.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Combining and Subdividing Theorems</title>
    <p>
      Sometimes it is useful to break a proof into pieces,
      akin to viewing a computer program as a collection of subroutines that you combine for some greater purpose.
      Usually the intention is to make the proof of a difficult result more readable,
      but you may also wish to emphasize the importance of certain aspects of your work.
      Mathematics does this by using <em>lemmas</em>
      and <em>corollaries.</em>
      <ul>
        <li class="custom-list-style-type">
          <p>
            <em>Lemma:</em> a theorem whose importance you want to downplay.
            Often the result is individually unimportant,
            but becomes more useful when referenced in the proof of a larger theorem.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="custom-list-style-type">
          <p>
            <em>Corollary:</em> a theorem which follows quickly from another result.
            Corollaries can be used to draw attention to a particular aspect or a special case of a theorem.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      In many mathematical papers the word <em>theorem</em>
      is reserved only for the most important results,
      everything else being presented as a lemma or corollary.
      The choice of what to call a result is entirely one of presentation.
      If you want your paper to be more readable,
      or to highlight what you think is important,
      then lemmas and corollaries are your friends![2]
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is a famous example of a lemma at work.
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="lemm_root2prep">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose that <m>n\in\Z</m>.
          Then <m>n^2</m> is even <m>\iff n</m> is even.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <p>
      Prove this yourself:
      the (<m>\Rightarrow</m>) direction is easiest using the contrapositive method,
      while the (<m>\Leftarrow</m>) direction works well directly.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm_root2">
      <statement>
        <p>
          <m>\sqrt 2</m> is irrational.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      This is tricky for a few reasons.
      The theorem does not appear to be of the form <m>\timplies P{Q,}</m>,
      nor does it seem to be any of the forms covered in this section.
      However, let us look a little closer at what is being claimed.
      Remember <em>irrational</em> simply means <em>not rational</em>,
      i.e., not of the form <m>m,n</m> for <m>m \in \Z</m> and <m>n \in \N</m>.
      Thus saying that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is irrational is equivalent to saying that there are no
      <m>m,n \in \N</m> such that <m>\sqrt{2} = \frac{m}{n}</m>.
      Phrased like this,
      we can see that the theorem statement is really a non-existence statement,
      and so it makes sense to try a proof by contradiction.

    </proof>
    <p>
      First observe how <xref ref="lemm_root2prep">Lemma</xref>
      was used to make the proof easier to read.
      Without the lemma,
      the essential shape of the proof would have been less clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now try to make sense of the proof.
      In the first line we invoke the definition of <em>rational,</em>
      being the <em>ratio</em> of two integers.
      The main challenge comes immediately afterwards.
      Once we assume that <m>\sqrt 2=\frac mn</m>,
      we can immediately insist that <m>m,n</m> have no common factors.
      Indeed this is no significant restriction
      <em>once we assume that <m>m,n</m> exist,</em> that is
      <em>once we assume that <m>\sqrt 2</m> is rational.</em>
      It is important to realize that the <sq>no common factors</sq> assumption is <em>not</em>
      the assumption being contradicted.
      Because of this subtlety,
      we include the phrase <sq>without loss of generality</sq> so that the reader is forced to think carefully,
      and does not jump to the wrong conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might seem difficult to completely understand,
      but if we hadn't made the observation,
      our calculation could have continued forever, telling us nothing!
      <me>
        m^2=2n^2\implies n^2=2k^2\implies k^2=2l^2\implies\cdots
      </me>

      If you find this approach difficult,
      you may prefer an alternative proof given in the exercises.

    <title>Non-constructive Proofs</title>
    <p>
      We saw earlier that we usually prove an existential statement by coming up with an explicit object and showing that it has the desired properties.
      Here is an example that shows that this can be a bit subtle.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          There are irrational numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> such that <m>a^b</m> is a rational number.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        By <xref ref="thm_root2">Theorem</xref>,
        we know that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is irrational.
        Consider the number <m>(\sqrt{2})^{\sqrt 2}</m>.
        There are two possibilities.
        If <m>(\sqrt{2})^{\sqrt 2}</m> is rational,
        then we can take <m>a = b = \sqrt 2</m> in the theorem statement and we're done.
        On the other hand,
        if <m>(\sqrt{2})^{\sqrt 2}</m> is irrational, then we have
        <me>
          \left(\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt 2}\right)^{\sqrt 2} = (\sqrt 2)^{\sqrt 2\cdot \sqrt 2} = (\sqrt 2)^2 = 2
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this case, we can take <m>a = (\sqrt 2)^{\sqrt 2}</m> and
        <m>b = \sqrt 2</m> in the theorem statement.
        In both cases we have found irrational numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> where <m>a^b</m> is rational.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      The critical, and perhaps unsatisfying,
      part of this proof is that we have <em>not</em>
      said whether or not <m>(\sqrt 2)^{\sqrt 2}</m> is rational.
      We then say that this proof is <em>non-constructive</em>
      since it does not actually contain explicit
      (and unconditional)
      irrational <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> with <m>a^b</m> rational.
      Instead, we have shown that the theorem is true <em>whether or not</em>
      <m>(\sqrt 2)^{\sqrt 2}</m> is rational.

    <title>Prime Numbers</title>
    <p>
      Here is another famous result,
      dating back at least to the Ancient Greeks (Euclid's
      <em>Elements</em>, Proposition IX.20).
      As ever, we need a solid definition before we try to prove anything.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="defn_irreducible">
      <statement>
        <p>
          An integer <m>\ge 2</m> is <em>prime</em>
          if the only positive integers it is divisible by are itself and 1.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The first few primes are <m>2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,\ldots</m> It follows<fn>
      This is not completely obvious:
      we will prove it much later in <xref ref="thm_fundarith">Theorem</xref>.
      </fn> from the definition that all positive integers <m>\ge 2</m> are either primes or <em>composites</em>
      (products of primes).
      In particular,
      every integer <m>\ge 2</m> is divisible by at least one prime.
      We may now state Euclid's result.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          There are infinitely many prime numbers.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We prove by contradiction.
        Assume there are exactly <m>n</m> prime numbers
        <m>\lst p n</m> and consider the integer
        <me>
          \Pi:=p_1\cdots p_n+1
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Certainly <m>\Pi</m> is divisible by some prime:
        since we are assuming that the list <m>\lst pn</m> contains
        <em>all</em> the primes,
        <m>\Pi</m> must be divisible by some prime <m>p_i</m> in the list.
        However, the product <m>p_1\cdots p_n</m> is clearly divisible by <m>p_i</m>,
        whence so is the difference<fn>
        Is this obvious?
        Can you prove it?!
        </fn>
        <me>
          \Pi-p_1\cdots p_n=1
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We conclude that 1 is divisible by the prime <m>p_i</m>,
        contradicting<fn>
        Euclid's original argument was not strictly by contradiction.
        Instead he asserted that, given any list of primes <m>p_1,\ldots,p_n</m>,
        the number <m>\Pi</m> must be divisible by a new prime not in his list.
        </fn> the fact that <m>p_i\ge 2</m>.
      </p>

          When proving a non-existence statement,

          In the proof that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is irrational,
