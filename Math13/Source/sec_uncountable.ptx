  <title>Uncountable Sets</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Since <m>\Q</m> seems so large,
      you might think that there cannot be any sets with strictly larger cardinality.
      But we haven't yet thought about the real numbers<ellipsis/>
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A set <m>A</m> is <term>uncountable</term>
          if <m>\nm A>\aleph_0</m>,
          that is if there exists an injection
          <m>f:\N\to A</m> but no bijection <m>g:\N\to A</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <theorem xml:id="thm_Cantordiag">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The interval <m>[0,1]</m> of real numbers is uncountable.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      We denote the cardinality of the interval <m>[0,1]</m> by the symbol <m>\fc</m> for <em>continuum.</em>
      The theorem may therefore be written <m>\fc>\aleph_0</m>.
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
        First we require an injective function <m>f:\N\to[0,1]</m>.
        The function defined by <m>f(n)=\frac 1n</m> clearly fits the bill, for
        <me>
          f(n)=f(m)\implies \frac 1n=\frac 1m\implies n=m
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now we prove that there exists no bijection
        <m>g:\N\to[0,1]</m>, arguing by contradiction.
        Suppose that <m>g</m> is such a bijection and consider the sequence of values
        <m>g(1),g(2),g(3),\ldots</m> These are real numbers between 0 and 1, hence they may all be expressed as decimals:<fn>
        A number has two decimal representations if and only if one of them terminates and the other ultimately becomes an infinite sequence of 9's.
        For the purposes of this proof it does not matter which representation is chosen when there is a choice.
        We are forced, however, to take <m>1=0.999999\cdots</m>,
        due to our insistence that all elements be written with zero units.
        </fn>
        <me>
          \begin{array}{c} g(1)=0.b_{11}b_{12}b_{13}b_{14}b_{15}b_{16}\cdots\\ g(2)=0.b_{21}b_{22}b_{23}b_{24}b_{25}b_{26}\cdots\\ g(3)=0.b_{31}b_{32}b_{33}b_{34}b_{35}b_{36}\cdots\\ g(4)=0.b_{41}b_{42}b_{43}b_{44}b_{45}b_{46}\cdots\\ g(5)=0.b_{51}b_{52}b_{53}b_{54}b_{55}b_{56}\cdots\\[-2pt] \vdots\\[-8pt] \end{array} \qquad\text{ where each } b_{ij}\in\{0,\ldots,9\}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>g</m> is bijective, it is certainly surjective.
        It follows that all of the values
        <m>c\in[0,1]</m> appear in the above list of decimals.
        Now define a new decimal
        <me>
          c=0.c_1c_2c_3c_4c_5\cdots\qquad\text{ where }  c_n=\begin{cases}1\amp \text{ if } b_{nn}\neq 1,\\ 2\amp \text{ if } b_{nn}=1. \end{cases}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>c</m> is a non-terminating decimal whose digits are 1's and 2's, whence it has no other representation.
        Since <m>c</m> disagrees with <m>g(n)</m> at the <m>n</m>th decimal place,
        we have <m>c\neq g(n),\ \forall n\in\N</m>.
        Hence <m>c</m> is <em>not</em> in the above list.
        However <m>c\in[0,1]</m> and <m>g</m> is surjective,
        whence <m>c\neq g(n)</m> for some <m>n\in\N</m>: a contradiction.
        We conclude that <m>\fc\neq\aleph_0</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Putting this together with the first part of the proof where <m>\fc\ge\aleph_0</m>,
        we conclude that <m>\fc>\aleph_0</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      The second part of the proof is known as
      <em>Cantor's diagonal argument,</em>
      since we are comparing the constructed decimal <m>c</m> with the diagonal of an infinite square of integers.
      We have proved that the interval <m>[0,1]</m> has a strictly larger cardinality than the set of integers.
      Since <m>[0,1]\subseteq\R</m>,
      it follows immediately that the real numbers are also uncountable.
      Indeed we shall see in a moment that the real numbers also have cardinality <m>\fc</m>,
      as does any interval
      (of positive width).
      More amazingly, the Cantor middle-third set
      (<xref ref="ex_cantor">page</xref>)
      also has cardinality <m>\fc</m>,
      despite seeming vanishingly small.

    <title>More advanced ideas</title>
    <p>
      Our countable and uncountable examples are merely scratching the surface of a truly weird subject.
      We conclude these notes with a couple more ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following theorem is very useful for being able to compare cardinalities.
      It allows us to prove that two sets have the same cardinality <em>without</em>
      explicitly constructing bijective functions.
      Injective functions are usually much easier to find.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <title>Cantor<ndash/>Schr&#xf6;der<ndash/>Bernstein</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>\nm A\le\nm B</m> and
          <m>\nm B\le\nm A</m>, then <m>\nm A=\nm B</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      The theorem seems like it should be obvious, but pause for a moment:
      it is <em>not</em> a result about <em>numbers!</em>
      <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are <em>sets,</em>
      and so the theorem must be understood in the context of <xref ref="defn_infcard">Definition</xref>.
      In this language the theorem becomes:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Suppose there exist <em>injective</em> functions <m>f:A\to B</m> and <m>g:B\to A</m>.
      Then there exists a <em>bijective</em> function <m>h:A\to B</m>.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The proof is beautiful, though a little long to reproduce here.
      If you are interested it can be found in any text on set theory.
      The applications of the theorem are more important to our purposes.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The interval <m>(0,1)</m> has cardinality <m>\fc</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      It is possible to explicitly define a bijection <m>h:(0,1)\to[0,1]</m>,
      although it is very messy.
      Instead we construct two injections.
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
        <m>f:(0,1)\to[0,1]:x\mapsto x</m> is clearly an injection,
        whence <m>\nm{(0,1)}\le\nm{[0,1]}=\fc</m>.
        Now define
        <me>
          g:[0,1]\to (0,1):x\mapsto \frac 12x+\frac 14
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>g</m> is certainly injective,
        and so <m>\fc\le\nm{(0,1)}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the Cantor<ndash/>Schr&#xf6;der<ndash/>Bernstein Theorem,
        the sets <m>(0,1)</m> and <m>[0,1]</m> have the same cardinality <m>\fc</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      In case you're feeling nervous,
      note that the function <m>g</m> in the proof isn't surjective:
      the range of <m>g</m> is the interval <m>[\frac 14,\frac 34]\neq (0,1)</m>.
      By a similar trick, covered in the Exercises,
      one can see that <m>\R</m> also has cardinality <m>\fc</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a final punchline, we prove Cantor's Theorem,
      which says that the power set of any set <m>A</m> always has a strictly larger cardinality than <m>A</m>.
      In <xref ref="thm_powercard">Theorem</xref>
      we saw that <m>\nm{\cP(A)}=2^{\nm A}</m> for finite sets <m>A</m>.
      We therefore already believe that Cantor's Theorem is true for finite sets.
      The proof that follows also works for infinite sets.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <title>Cantor</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>A</m> is any set, then <m>\nm A\lneq\nm{\cP(A)}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        If <m>A=\emptyset</m>, the result is trivial.
        Otherwise, we must show two things:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\exists f:A\to\cP(A)</m> which is injective.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\nexists g:A\to\cP(A)</m> which is bijective.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        For the first,
        note that <m>f:a\mapsto\{a\}</m> is a suitable injective function.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now suppose for a contradiction that <m>\exists g:A\to\cP(A)</m> which is bijective.
        That is, <m>g(a)</m> is a subset of <m>A</m> for each <m>a\in A</m>.
        Consider the set
        <me>
          X=\{a\in A:a\not\in g(a)\}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important to note that <m>X</m>
        <em>is a subset of <m>A</m>.</em>
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      We pause the proof for a moment,
      as the set <m>X</m> is somewhat tricky to think about.
      Before proceeding, let us consider an example.
      Suppose that <m>g:\{1,2\}\to\cP(\{1,2\})</m> is defined by
      <me>
        g(1)=\{1,2\},\qquad g(2)=\{1\}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then <m>1\in g(1)</m> and <m>2\not\in g(2)</m>,
      whence the above set is <m>X=\{2\}</m>.
      Since we are trying to prove that no bijection <m>g:A\to\cP(A)</m> exists,
      it is important to note that the function <m>g</m> in our example is <em>not bijective!</em>
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
        By assumption, <m>g</m> is bijective,
        hence it is certainly surjective.
        Because the range of <m>g</m> is the power set <m>\cP(A)</m>,
        the set <em><m>X</m> lies in the image of <m>g</m>.</em> Otherwise said,
        there exists <m>b\in A</m> such that <m>g(b)=X</m>.
        We ask whether <m>b</m> is an element of <m>X</m>.
        Think carefully about the definition of <m>X</m>, and observe that
        <md>
          <mrow>b\in X\amp \iff b\not\in g(b)\tag{(by the definition of $X$)}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp \iff b\not\in X\tag{(since $X=g(b)$)}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        Look at what we have concluded:
        <m>b\in X\iff b\not\in X</m>.
        This is clearly a contradiction!
      </p>
      <p>
        It follows that there exists no bijection <m>g:A\to\cP(A)</m>,
        and so <m>\nm A\lneq\nm{\cP(A)}</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      The main implication of this is that
      <em>there is no largest cardinality!</em>
      We can always construct a larger set simply by taking the power set of what we already have.
      For example,
      <m>\cP(\R)</m> has larger cardinality than <m>\R</m>.
      If you want a set with even larger cardinality,
      why not take <m>\cP(\cP(\R))</m>?
      Or <m>\cP(\cP(\cP(\R)))</m>.
      We can continue this process indefinitely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cantor's Theorem played a large part in pushing set theory towards axiomatization.
      Here is a conundrum motivated by the theorem: If a <sq>set</sq> is just a collection of objects,
      then we may consider the <sq>set of all sets.</sq> Call this <m>A</m>.
      Now consider the power set of <m>A</m>.
      Since <m>\cP(A)</m> is a set of sets,
      it must be a subset of <m>A</m>,
      whence <m>\nm{\cP(A)}\le\nm A</m>.
      However, by Cantor's Theorem,
      we have <m>\nm A\lneq\nm{\cP(A))}</m>.
      The conclusion is the manifest absurdity
      <me>
        \nm{A}\lneq\nm{A}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The remedy is a thorough definition of <sq>set</sq> which prevents the collection of all sets from being considered a set.
      This is where <em>axiomatic set theory</em> begins.

    <title>A word on the limits of proof</title>
    <p>
      Throughout this course we have learned about some of the basic methods and and concepts used by the mathematician.
      In particular,
      we learned about various types of proof and how to use these proofs to demonstrate the truth of statements about mathematical objects.
      As we finish the course,
      it makes sense to reflect on the limits of our methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the early 20th century,
      the discovery of various paradoxes and contradictions led to a foundational crises in mathematics.
      After all, it is difficult to build a house if you have cracks in your foundation!
      The result was an effort to put all of mathematics on a rigorous axiomatic basis by formulating a list of reasonable axioms from which all of mathematics could be derived,
      using basic logical reasoning.
      This axiomatic foundation ideally would satisfy the following conditions:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>consistency</em>,
            i.e. no contradiction would be derivable from the axioms;
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>completeness</em>,
            i.e. all true mathematical statements would be derivable from the axioms.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      The hope for such a foundation was crushed in 1931,
      when a young logician by the name of Kurt G&#xf6;del published his famous
      <em>Incompleteness Theorems</em>
      which showed that no such axiomatic system could exist.
      Essentially, G&#xf6;del showed that in any consistent axiomatic system that was strong enough to produce some basic arithmetic,
      there must be statements which are neither derivable nor refutable from the axioms.
      Perhaps even worse, no such system can prove its own consistency.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the strongest aims of some of the early 20th century attempts at an axiomatic foundation cannot be accomplished,
      the research of that time was able to provide a foundation that most modern mathematicians deem adequate for current work.
      Perhaps the most popular approach is to base all of mathematics on set theory <mdash/> you will see as your studies progress that many of the objects you study can be formalized as sets together with functions and relations between sets.
      We have seen in <xref ref="sec_relations">Chapter</xref>
      that functions and relations are just themselves sets.
      Even numbers like <m>0,1,2</m> or <m>\frac{12}{19}</m> or
      <m>3.14\ldots</m> can be thought of as sets, if one desires.
      In turn, set theory is often axiomatized using the \textrm{ZFC} axioms
      (short for Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice).
    </p>
    <p>
      While the \textrm{ZFC} axioms are subject to the limitations imposed by G&#xf6;del's theorems,
      they have proven themselves by being able to formalize most of the mathematics actually used by current mathematicians,
      and have so far not produced any inconsistencies.
      Thus most mathematicians feel little need to dwell on the foundational issues of the previous century.

                Russell's paradox is one avatar of an ancient logical conundrum which appears in many guises.
                For example, suppose that a town has one hairdresser,
                and suppose that the hairdresser is the person who cuts the hair of all the people,
                and only those people, who do not cut their own hair.
                Who then cuts the hairdresser's hair?
                Can you explain the connection with Russell's paradox/Cantor's Theorem?
