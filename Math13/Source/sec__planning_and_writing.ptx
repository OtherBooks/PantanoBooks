  <title>Planning and Writing a Proof</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Your main responsibility for the rest of this course is to write proofs.
      If you look back at any of the conjectures on <xref ref="conjectures-true-or-false">page</xref>,
      there might be a question on your mind <mdash/> <em>how do I prove
      (or disprove)
      this?</em> If you read a proof
      (or disproof)
      written by someone else,
      you might have the related question <mdash/>
      <em>how did they ever come up with this proof?</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      The source of a proof is often less magical than it appears:
      usually the original author of the proof experimented until they found something that worked.
      Most of that experimentation gets hidden in the final written proof.
      The proof itself should be written in the way that is easiest to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to bridge the gap between what goes into thinking about a proof and what the proof actually looks like,
      we recommend splitting the proof writing process into the following four steps.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <title>Interpret</title>
          <p>
            Make sense of the statement.
            What is the proposition saying?
            Can you rephrase the claim in a way that is more clear to you?
            What are you trying to prove and what are you assuming?
            The most important part of this step is identifying the
            <em>logical structure</em>
            of the statement you're trying to prove.
            At this stage,
            you might ignore the particular details of the statement and instead focus on its logical meaning.
            Depending on the statement,
            it might be helpful to rephrase the statement as an if-then statement.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Brainstorm</title>
          <p>
            Now that you understand what the statement is saying,
            convince <em>yourself</em> that the statement is true.
            First, look up the relevant definitions.
            Next, think of some instances where the conditions of this proposition are met.
            Try out some examples,
            and ask yourself what makes the claim work in those instances.
            Looking carefully at examples may help build intuition about <em>why</em>
            the claim is true and suggest a strategy to prove it.
            You'll also want to review other theorems that relate to these definitions.
            What theorems involve the same definitions?
            Do you know any theorems that relate your assumptions to the conclusion?
            Have you seen a proof for a similar statement before?
            This stage is a little like packing for a trip.
            Imagine laying out all the stuff you might want to bring,
            looking to get an overview of what you have available.
            Even if you don't end up bringing that fourth pair of shoes,
            maybe it was helpful to remind yourself of all the options.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Sketch</title>
          <p>
            This is the phase where you build the skeleton of your proof.
            Think again about what you are assuming and what you are are you trying to prove.
            What should the <em>first</em> step of the proof be?
            What about the <em>last</em> step?
            Write down some informal arguments for yourself to connect the first and last steps of your proof,
            feeling free to use shorthand.
            If you get stuck, try a different approach.
            Scribble out some drawings and draw as many arrows as you want to connect your ideas.
            This <em>sketch</em> step is where most of the thinking happens and it will most likely be the longest step in the proof-writing process.
            This is also the step where you will be doing most of your calculations.
            You can be as messy as you want in this step because <em>you</em>
            should be the only one who ever reads this.
            Once you've learned a variety of different proof methods,
            this is a good stage at which to experiment with them and try to find which proof method will work best.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Prove</title>
          <p>
            Once you have proven the statement to yourself,
            it's time to prove the statement to the world.
            Now is when you go back through your proof sketch and translate it into a linear story,
            written in complete sentences.
            Here you should carefully word your explanations and you should avoid using shorthand.
            The result should be a clear,
            formal proof like the ones you read in a mathematics textbook,
            where symbols like <m>\Longrightarrow</m> or
            <m>\therefore</m> are replaced by words like
            <q>hence</q>
            or
            <q>therefore</q>. Although you are providing a mathematical argument,
            your proof should read like prose.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Review</title>
          <p>
            Finally, you should <em>review</em> your proof.
            Assume that the reader is looking at the problem for the first time and has not read your sketch.
            Read your own proof with some skepticism and consider its readability and flow.
            Get read of unnecessary claims and revise the wording if necessary.
            During this review step, try also reading your proof out loud.
            If you find yourself adding extra words that aren't written down,
            then include those words in the proof.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's use this framework to prove the following theorem.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A positive integer <m>n</m> is divisible by 5 when its last digit is 5.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      First, we need to make sense of the statement of the theorem.
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
        What is the logical structure of this statement we are trying to prove?
        In this case,
        it has deliberately been written in a less-than-straightforward way.
        Don't just read the words in the statement,
        but read it slowly and carefully enough that you understand what it is asserting.
        Once you understand what this sentence means,
        it is possible to translate it into an if-then statement.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <em>Equivalent statement</em>: Let <m>n</m> be a positive integer.
              If the last digit of <m>n</m> is 5, then <m>n</m> is divisible by 5.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      Not every statement can be rewritten as an if-then statement,
      but many can, including this statement we are trying to prove.
      Before moving on,
      be sure you agree that our statement really means the same thing as what we wrote above.
      Understanding the English meaning of the statement was essential to writing it as an if-then statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's hopeless to try to memorize all the possibilities
      (in general,
      this course will involve less memorization than your earlier math classes).
      Instead of memorizing that a statement with the logical structure
      <q>P when Q</q>
      is the same as
      <q>if Q then P</q>, you should instead think about the natural English meaning of the sentences,
      and make sure they are equivalent. (It might be helpful to try an example sentence that doesn't involve math;
      can you think of one in this case, using the structure
      <q>P when Q</q>?)
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we move on to the brainstorm phase,
      where we gather examples and definitions related to our theorem.
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
        A key practice is to write out the relevant definitions.
        We are already comfortable with the notion of <em>divisibility</em>,
        but the precise notion of <em>digits</em>
        is probably less familiar.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Definition of
              <q>divisible by 5</q>: An integer <m>n</m> is <em>divisible</em>
              by <m>5</m> if there exists an integer <m>k</m> such that <m>n = 5k</m>.
              That is, <m>n</m> is a multiple of <m>5</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Meaning of
              <q>digit</q>: Each digit of <m>n</m> is a number between 0 and 9, representing how many 1's, 10's, 100's, etc. are
              <q>in</q>
              <m>n</m>.
              (For example,
              the number 671 has six hundreds, seven tens, and a one.
              That is, <m>671 = 6\cdot 100 + 7\cdot 10 + 1</m>.)
              More formally,
              if <m>n</m> is a <m>k</m>-digit number and its digits are <m>n_0, n_1, \ldots,
              n_{k-1}</m>, then
              <men xml:id="digit_sum">
                n = n_{k-1}\cdot 10^{k-1} + n_{k-2}\cdot 10^{k-2} + \cdots + n_1\cdot 10 + n_0
              </men>.
              Thus,
              <q>last digit 5</q>
              means <m>n_0 = 5</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Do we believe this statement is true?
        Let's try out some examples.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>15 = 3 \cdot 5</m> is divisible by 5.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>245 = 49 \cdot 5</m> is divisible by 5.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The theorem claims that <em>every</em>
        positive integer ending in <m>5</m> is a multiple of <m>5</m>, or,
        as we rephrased it,
        <em>if</em> a positive integer ends in <m>5</m>,
        <em>then</em> it is divisible by <m>5</m>.
        How important is that assumption,
        that the last digit is <m>5</m>?
        Here are some more examples.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>13</m> is not divisible by <m>5</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>20 = 4 \cdot 5</m> is divisible by <m>5</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        From these examples,
        we notice that not all positive integers are divisible by <m>5</m> (okay,
        we probably already knew that),
        and that some positive integers which do not end in <m>5</m> are divisible by <m>5</m> (e.g., <m>20</m>).
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      The brainstorming phase is also a good time to write out relevant theorems.
      In this case, I don't think we know any theorems that will help us,
      but as we learn more theorems,
      we will have more options available to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example,
      imagine we knew a theorem that said, ``A number is divisible by <m>5</m> if and only if its last digit is <m>0</m> or <m>5</m>." That theorem would instantly imply what we're trying to prove
      (and more). (<term>Warning!</term>
      If you stumble upon a one-sentence proof like this on an exam,
      probably your instructor doesn't want you using that theorem,
      and at the very least you should ask to confirm whether or not it's okay to use.)
    </p>
    <p>
      As another example,
      imagine we knew a theorem that said, ``If the last digit of a positive integer is <m>6</m>,
      then that positive integer is divisible by <m>2</m>." This theorem itself wouldn't help us prove our result,
      but its proof would very likely be helpful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next we have the <em>sketch</em> portion of the proof.
      Let's revisit our examples and experiment to try to discover
      <em>why</em> this statement is true.
      We will make use of our description above of what it means to have last digit equal to <m>5</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our final proof needs to be written in complete sentences,
      but since the sketch portion is just for us, we can be less formal.
      Here is how a sketch of this proof might look.
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Our examples:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>15 = 1 \cdot 10 + 5 = 1 \cdot \underbrace{2 \cdot 5}_{10} + 5 = 5\cdot (2 + 1)</m> <nbsp/><nbsp/> (a multiple of <m>5</m>).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>245 = 2 \cdot 10^2 + 4 \cdot 10^1 + 5= 2 \cdot 10 \cdot \underbrace{2 \cdot 5}_{10} + 4 \cdot \underbrace{2 \cdot 5}_{10} + 5 = 5 \cdot (40 + 8 + 1)</m> <nbsp/><nbsp/> (a multiple of <m>5</m>).
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        (Commentary, not part of the sketch.
      </p>
      <p>
        The key idea here is that we can pull out a 5 from each power of 10 and from the last digit
        (which is a 5).
        This will be our general strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
        We now explore the general case,
        using the strategy suggested by the previous examples.
        At this stage, we focus on outlining the main ideas,
        and do not bother about writing down a formal proof.
        The bullet points here aren't essential;
        they are just there to make it a little easier for you to read.
      </p>
      <p>
        End of commentary, back to the sketch.)
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>n = n_{k-1}\cdot 10^{k-1} + n_{k-2}\cdot 10^{k-2} + \cdots + n_1\cdot 10 + 5 \text{ \;\;\;(last digit 5) }</m>

            <p>
              <m>10</m>, <m>10^2</m>, <m>10^3</m>, ... are all multiples of <m>5</m>.

              (in general),
              but this is irrelevant to us.

            <p>
              <m>n_{k-1}\cdot 10^{k-1} + n_{k-2}\cdot 10^{k-2} + \cdots + n_1\cdot 10</m> is a multiple of 5.

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>n</m> is a multiple of <m>5</m> because

                n = \underbrace{n_{k-1}\cdot 10^{k-1} + n_{k-2}\cdot 10^{k-2} + \cdots + n_1\cdot 10}_{\text{ \(5 \cdot\) (an integer) } } + \underbrace{5}_{5 \cdot 1} \text{ \;\;(last digit 5) }
              </me>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              So <m>5</m> divides <m>n</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      The authors had a difficult time writing this
      <q>sketch</q>
      portion, because, on one hand,
      we want to explain what we're thinking.
      On the other hand,
      we want to show you what a sketch looks like in real life.
      The sketch is usually quite messy,
      and is nearly impossible for anyone else to follow.
      In fact, a common struggle for professional mathematicians is returning to a sketch they wrote weeks or months ago,
      and trying to figure out what their scratchwork meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, let's turn this sketch into a formal proof that a classmate would be able to follow.
      There is a certain writing style used in most formal mathematical proofs.
      We will use that style in the following,
      and you will get more used to it in the more proofs you read
      (and write).
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We need to show that if the positive integer <m>n</m> has last digit 5, then <m>n</m> is divisible by 5.
        Write <m>n</m> in its base-10 expansion:
        <md>
          <mrow>n \amp = n_{k-1}\cdot 10^{k-1} + n_{k-2}\cdot 10^{k-2} + \cdots + n_1\cdot 10 + n_0</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = n_{k-1}\cdot 10^{k-1} + n_{k-2}\cdot 10^{k-2} + \cdots + n_1\cdot 10 + 5</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that for all <m>j \geq 1</m>,
        <m>10^j</m> is a multiple of 5.
        Hence, for all <m>j=1,\dots, k-1</m>,
        there exists an integer <m>a_j</m> such that we can write <m>10^j = a_j \cdot 5</m>.
        Thus, we get:
        <md>
          <mrow>n \amp = n_{k-1}\cdot (a_{k-1} \cdot 5) + n_{k-2}\cdot (a_{k-2} \cdot 5) + \cdots + n_1\cdot (a_{1} \cdot 5) + 5</mrow>
          <intertext>(by associativity of multiplication)</intertext>
          <mrow>\amp = (n_{k-1}\cdot a_{k-1} )\cdot 5 + (n_{k-2}\cdot a_{k-2}) \cdot 5 + \cdots +( n_1\cdot a_{1}) \cdot 5 + 1\cdot 5</mrow>
          <intertext>(by distributivity)</intertext>
          <mrow>\amp = (n_{k-1}\cdot a_{k-1} + n_{k-2}\cdot a_{k-2} + \cdots + n_1\cdot a_1 +1 ) \cdot 5</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the quantity <m>n_{k-1}\cdot a_{k-1} + n_{k-2}\cdot a_{k-2} + \cdots + n_1\cdot a_1 +1</m> is an integer,
        this shows that <m>n</m> is a multiple of 5.
        Hence, <m>n</m> is divisible by 5.
        This completes the proof.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      Finally, we review the proof and try to make it more readable.
      At the beginning of your career as a proof writer,
      you will be required to justify every claim in your proof
      (hence, for example, the reference to associativity above).
      You may think we are being too picky,
      but this initial requirement is just an attempt to get you in the habit of explaining your claims.
      As you gain more practice with proof writing,
      you will be expected to include fewer details in your proof and will even be allowed to skip some simple steps that most readers may consider
      <q>trivial</q>
      (because they believe they are true without feeling the need for an explanation).
      Thus, a more experienced proof-writer may review the proof above and present a more compact version,
      like the one offered below.
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We need to show that if the positive integer <m>n</m> has last digit 5, then <m>n</m> is divisible by 5.
        Write <m>n</m> in its base-10 expansion:
        <md>
          <mrow>n \amp = n_{k-1}\cdot 10^{k-1} + n_{k-2}\cdot 10^{k-2} + \cdots + n_1\cdot 10 + n_0</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = n_{k-1}\cdot 10^{k-1} + n_{k-2}\cdot 10^{k-2} + \cdots + n_1\cdot 10 + 5</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>10^j</m> is a multiple of 5 for all <m>j \geq 1</m>,
        the sum of the first <m>k-1</m> terms on the right-hand side is divisible by 5 (i.e., the terms from
        <m>n_{k-1}\cdot 10^{k-1}</m> to <m>n_1\cdot 10</m>).
        Of course, 5 is also divisible by 5.
        Thus, their sum <m>n</m> is also divisible by <m>5</m>.
        This completes the proof.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      Some comments:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Whether in the longer version of the proof,
            or the shorter version of the proof,
            we didn't fully justify that the sum of <m>k-1</m> terms which are divisible by <m>5</m> is divisible by <m>5</m>.
            In fact, at this stage, we may not even have one of the necessary tools
            (mathematical induction)
            to make that claim 100% rigorous.
            In this proof, we are asking the reader to accept that it is
            <q>obvious</q>.

            If you ask 5 mathematicians to prove this statement,
            you will get 5 different proofs
            (like our two versions above),
            possibly vastly different.
            Some aspects will be consistent
            (for example, the use of complete sentences,
            and the fact that <m>10</m> is divisible by <m>5</m>),
            but the proofs themselves could look quite different.

            Don't expect to immediately be able to write a proof in the style of our proof;
            instead, focus on correctness, clarity,
            using complete sentences, and including all necessary steps.
            The writing style of your proofs will develop as you read and write more proofs.

      Here is another example, illustrating the <em>interpreting</em>,
      <em>brainstorming</em> and <em>sketching</em>
      portions of our proof-writing process.
      We won't fully prove this proposition,
      but we will illustrate some first steps in the proof-discovery process.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the following proposition:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Every function <m>f: \R \rightarrow \R</m> represented by a degree<nbsp/><m>2</m> polynomial is non-constant.</em>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                <nbsp/> [Interpret] We rewrite this statement as an if-then statement.
                The result is quite similar to the original statement
                (and of course, is identical in meaning,
                the whole point is to not change the meaning).
                Answer: If a function <m>f: \R \rightarrow \R</m> is represented by a degree<nbsp/><m>2</m> polynomial,
                then <m>f</m> is non-constant.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <nbsp/> [Brainstorm] What are the most important definitions to recall for this problem?
                Write down those definitions carefully.
                Answer:
                <q>Degree<nbsp/>2 polynomial</q>
                and
                <q>non-constant function</q>. A <em>degree<nbsp/>2 polynomial</em>
                is a polynomial which can be written in the form
                <m>n_2 x^2 + n_1 x + n_0</m>, where <m>n_2 \neq 0</m>.
                A function <m>f</m> is <em>non-constant</em>
                if there exist inputs <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> such that <m>f(a) \neq f(b)</m>.
                Thus the theorem says that if
                <m>f(x) = n_2 x^2 + n_1 x + n_0</m> with <m>n_2 \neq 0</m>,
                then we can find two values <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>
                (with <m>a\neq b</m>)
                such that <m>f(a) \neq f(b)</m>.
                Make a few examples to convince yourself that the statement is true.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      <m>f(x) = x^2 + 1</m> is a degree 2 polynomial.
                      It is not constant because <m>f(0)=1</m> but <m>f(1)=2</m>. (A less formal justification that it's non-constant:
                      the graph of <m>f(x)</m> is not a horizontal line.)
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      <m>f(x) = x^2 - x</m> is a degree 2 polynomial.
                      It is not constant because <m>f(0)=0</m> but <m>f(-1)=2</m>.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              Plan: Following the same strategy used in the previous examples,
              we can try to plug in some small values of <m>x</m>.
              Hopefully, the corresponding outputs will be distinct.
              (If not, we will try some more inputs.)
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <nbsp/> [Sketch] Let's try plugging in <m>0</m>, <m>1</m>,
                and <m>-1</m> to our general polynomial <m>n_2 x^2 + n_1 x + n_0</m>.
                We get:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      <m>f(0) = n_0</m>
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      <m>f(1) = n_2 + n_1 + n_0</m>
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      <m>f(-1) = n_2 - n_1 + n_0</m>.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              Can we find two values that have different outputs?
              Answer: If <m>f(1) \neq f(0)</m>, we are done.
              Otherwise, if <m>f(1) = f(0)</m>, consider <m>f(-1)</m>.
              We will show that <m>f(-1) \neq f(1)</m>,
              because if <m>f(-1) = f(1)=f(0)</m>,
              then <m>f</m> cannot have degree <m>2</m>.
              Here are the details: suppose <m>f(1) = f(0)</m>,
              then <m>n_2 + n_1 = 0</m>.
              If <m>f(-1) = f(1)</m>, then <m>n_1 = -n_1</m>, so <m>n_1 = 0</m>.
              So if <m>f(0) = f(1) = f(-1)</m>, then <m>n_2 = 0</m>,
              but that means <m>f</m> is not a degree<nbsp/><m>2</m> polynomial.
              Since we assumed <m>f</m> is a degree<nbsp/><m>2</m> polynomial,
              we know that <m>f(0) = f(1) = f(-1)</m> is impossible,
              so <m>f</m> is not a constant polynomial.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      We are not quite ready to write out a formal proof using the suggested strategy,
      because that strategy is secretly using the proof technique
      <q>proof by contradiction</q>
      which we will cover soon.
      Instead, let's practice reviewing
      <q>proofs</q>
      by evaluating some alternative arguments to prove our proposition
      (which may, or may not, be logically correct).
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the same statement as above.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Every function <m>f: \R \rightarrow \R</m> represented by a degree<nbsp/><m>2</m> polynomial is non-constant.</em>
          Are the following arguments valid proofs?
          If not, why not?
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <nbsp/>
                <q>Proof</q>: Consider the degree<nbsp/>2 polynomial <m>f(x) = 3x^2 - 5x + 7</m>.
                This is not a constant polynomial,
                because <m>f(0) = 7</m> and <m>f(1) = 5</m>.
                Is it a valid proof?
                Answer.
                This is not a valid proof, because it is providing a single example.
                A complete proof needs to work for <em>every</em>
                degree<nbsp/>2 polynomial, not just one.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <nbsp/>
                <q>Proof</q>: A degree<nbsp/>2 polynomial is a parabola
                (concave up, if the leading coefficient is positive,
                and concave down, if the leading coefficient is negative).
                In either case,
                the graph is not a horizontal line, so it is non-constant.
                Is it a valid proof?
                Answer.
                There is nothing <em>incorrect</em> with this proof,
                but it also feels incomplete.
                Everything involving concave up or concave down seems like it would need to be justified
                (what is even the definition of these terms?)
                and justifying them would probably be more difficult than proving the original statement.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <nbsp/>
                <q>Proof</q>: Let <m>f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c</m> be represented by a degree 2 polynomial
                (thus <m>a\neq 0</m>),
                and assume it is constant.
                Because <m>f</m> is constant,
                then its derivative is zero, so <m>2ax + b = 0</m> for all <m>x</m>.
                But this is only possible if <m>a = b = 0</m>.
                Given that <m>a = 0</m>, <m>f</m> is not a degree<nbsp/>2 polynomial.
                Is it a valid proof?
                Answer.
                Assuming we are allowed to use properties of derivatives in our proof,
                then this is a correct and complete proof.
                (Ask your professor if you're unsure what tools you are allowed to use in a proof.)
                You may be surprised by the approach we took in this proof:
                the way we proved that <m>f</m> is <em>not</em>
                constant is by showing that it cannot be otherwise;
                indeed, if we assumed that <m>f</m> were constant,
                we would reach some nonsense.
                As we will see shortly, this is an example of a
                <q>proof by contradiction</q>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <nbsp/>
                <q>Proof</q>: The only constant polynomials are degree<nbsp/>zero,
                and because <m>0 \neq 2</m>,
                a degree<nbsp/>two polynomial cannot be a constant function.
                Is it a valid proof?
                Answer.
                Again, there is nothing incorrect in what's written here, but the
                <q>proof</q>
                is essentially stating as obvious something that immediately implies what we are trying to prove.
                Not only the statement
                <q>The only constant polynomials are degree zero</q>
                is not trivial, and hence requires a proof,
                but it is actually a more elaborate
                (and general)
                result than the proposition we are trying to prove.
                This last argument is definitely not a complete proof in our context.
                (If your proof seems too easy,
                for example if it's a midterm and you're given a whole page but only need one sentence,
                you should worry that you might be assuming too much.)

          Critique the following proof.
          That is, fix any mathematical errors and suggest ways to make the proof more clear.
          Prove or disprove:
          an integer is composite if and only if it has two distinct prime factors.
          <proof>
            <p>
              The claim is false.
              An integer is composite if it is not prime.
              For example,
              the number 6 is composite because <m>6 = 2\cdot 3</m>.
              But <m>4 = 2\cdot 2</m>.

          Consider the following definition.
          <term>Definition</term>: For integers <m>n, a</m>,
          and a positive integer <m>d</m>,
          we write <m>n\equiv a\pmod d</m> if <m>n</m> is the sum of <m>a</m> and an integer multiple of <m>d</m>.
          Now consider the statement:
          <em>If <m>n\equiv 1 \pmod 2</m> and <m>m\equiv 1\pmod4</m>,
          then <m>n^2-m</m> is divisible by 4.</em>
          Below is a sketch of a proof of this statement.
          Unfortunately, it is incorrect.
          Find the mistake(s) in the sketch and explain your reasoning.

          Consider the following claim:  <term>Claim</term>:
          <em>There are infinitely many prime numbers.</em>  The claim is true,
          but the proof given below contains one extraneous statement.
          Such a statement is a sentence that,
          if deleted, does not change the validity of the proof.
          Find the extraneous statement and briefly justify why it does not change the proof.
          <proof>
            <p>
              Assume there are exactly <m>n</m> prime numbers
              <m>2\le p_1, ..., p_n</m> and consider the integer
              <me>
                N = p_1\cdots p_n+1
              </me>.
            </p>
            <p>
              <m>N</m> is an odd number since <m>p_1=2</m> and <m>N=2(p_2\cdots p_n)+1</m>.
              Certainly <m>N</m> is divisible by some prime <m>p_j</m> in the list since we are assuming that the list <m>p_1,...,p_n</m> contains all primes.
              Thus
              <me>
                N-p_1p_2\cdots p_n=1
              </me>
              is divisible by that <m>p_j</m>.
              This is a contradiction since 1 is not divisible by an integer <m>p_j\ge2</m>.
            </p>
          </proof>

          We give three attempts to prove the following statement: For any positive real numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>,
          <m>\frac{a+b}{2}\geq \sqrt{ab}</m>.
          Below, three attempts of a proof are given.
          <em>Attempt 1:</em> Assuming that <m>\frac{a+b}{2}\geq \sqrt{ab}</m>,
          we can multiply both sides by 2, which is positive, to get
          <me>
            a+b\geq 2\sqrt{ab}
          </me>
          Squaring, we get
          <md>
            <mrow>(a+b)^2 \amp \geq 4ab</mrow>
            <mrow>a^2+2ab+b^2 \amp \geq 4ab</mrow>
            <mrow>a^2-2ab+b^2 \amp \geq 0</mrow>
            <mrow>(a-b)^2 \amp \geq 0</mrow>
          </md>
          Since we have arrived at a true statement,
          the initial assumption must be true.
          Thus, <m>\frac{a+b}{2}\geq \sqrt{ab}</m> as desired.
          <em>Attempt 2:</em> For all positive numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>,
          we have <m>(\sqrt{a}-\sqrt{b})^2\geq 0</m>.
          Thus, <m>a-2\sqrt{a}\sqrt{b}+b\geq 0</m>,
          which is equivalent to <m>a+b\geq 2\sqrt{ab}</m>.
          Dividing by 2, which is positive,
          we obtain <m>\frac{a+b}{2}\geq \sqrt{ab}</m>, as desired.
          <em>Attempt 3:</em> Let <m>a = 18</m> and <m>b=2</m>.
          Then <m>\frac{a+b}{2} = 10</m> and <m>\sqrt{ab} = 6</m>.
          <m>10\geq 6</m> so this is true.

          Given below is the proof of a statement.
          Determine which statement the proof is trying to show.
          <proof>
            <p>
              Let <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> be integers.
              Assume that <m>m-n</m> is odd,
              say <m>m-n=2t+1</m> for some integer <m>t</m>.
              We consider two cases:
            </p>
            <p>
              If <m>n</m> is odd, then <m>n=2s+1</m> for some integer <m>s</m>.
              Thus
              <me>
                m=(m-n)+n=(2t+1)+(2s+1)=2(t+s+1)
              </me>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because <m>t+s+1</m> is an integer,
              this shows that <m>m</m> is even.
            </p>
            <p>
              If <m>n</m> is even, then <m>n=2s</m> for some integer <m>s</m>.
              Thus
              <me>
                m=(m-n)+n=(2t+1)+2(s)=2(t+s)+1
              </me>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because <m>t+s</m> is an integer,
              this shows that <m>m</m> is odd.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hence <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> have opposite parity.
            </p>

          Consider the following definition.
          <term>Definition</term>: Let <m>f</m> real-valued function on the set of real numbers.
          If <m>f(z)=0</m>, then we call <m>z</m> a
          <term>zero</term> of <m>f</m>.
          Suppose <m>f</m> is a function and <m>S</m> is your favorite subset of the real numbers.
          If we want to prove that the set of all zeros of <m>f</m> is contained in a set <m>S</m>,
          what can we assume and what do we want to show?
