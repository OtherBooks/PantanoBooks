  <title>Partitions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Recall the important observation about our equivalence relation examples:
      every element of the original set of objects ends up in
      <em>exactly one equivalence class.</em> For instance,
      every integer is either even or odd but not both.
      The equivalence classes <em>partition</em>
      the original set in the same way that cutting a cake partitions the crumbs:
      each crumb ends up in exactly one slice.
      We shall prove in a moment that equivalence relations
      <em>always</em> do this.
      Before doing so we reverse the discussion.

          Let <m>X</m> be a set and <m>\{A_n:n\in I\}</m> be a collection of non-empty subsets <m>A_n\subseteq X</m>.
          We say that <m>X</m> is <term>partitioned by</term>
          the collection of subsets if
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>X=\bigcup\limits_{n\in I}A_n</m>.(the <m>A_n</m> together make up <m>X</m>)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If <m>A_m\neq A_n</m>,
                then <m>A_m\cap A_n=\emptyset</m>.(<em>distinct</em>
                <m>A_n</m> are pairwise disjoint<fn>
                Recall that two sets <m>A,B</m> are
                <em>disjoint</em> if <m>A\cap B=\emptyset</m>:
                see <xref ref="defn_unionint">Definition</xref>.
                In this definition we <em>don't</em>
                require the sets <m>A_n</m> all to be different,
                some could be identical to each other.
                </fn>)
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          We describe the collection <m>\cA</m> as a
          <term>partition</term> of <m>X</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The conditions can be viewed as saying that every element of <m>X</m> lies in (1.) <em>at least one</em>
      subset <m>A_n</m> and (2.) <em>at most one</em> subset <m>A_n</m>:
      otherwise said, every element of <m>X</m> lies in
      <em>exactly one</em> subset.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Partition the set <m>X=\{1,2,3,4,5\}</m> into subsets
          <me>
            A_1=\{1,3\},\qquad A_2=\{2,4\},\qquad A_3=\{5\}
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now consider the relation <m>\cR</m> on <m>X</m>, defined by
          <me>
            \cR=\{(1,1),(1,3),(3,1),(3,3),(2,2),(2,4),(4,2),(4,4),(5,5)\}
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          What does <m>\cR</m> have to do with the partition?
          It should be clear that <m>\cR</m> could be defined by insisting that
          <me>
            x\,\cR\,y\iff \text{\(x\) and \(y\) are in the \emph{same} subset \(A_n\).}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Run through your mental checklist:
          is <m>\cR</m> reflexive? symmetric? transitive?
          Indeed <m>\cR</m> is an equivalence relation!
          Moreover, the equivalence classes of <m>\cR</m> are precisely the sets <m>A_1,A_2</m> and <m>A_3</m>.
          For instance, 1 is related to itself and 3, but isn't related to anything else.
          Indeed
          <me>
            [1]=[3]=\{1,3\}=A_1,\qquad [2]=[4]=\{2,4\}=A_2,\qquad [5]=\{5\}=A_5
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      The example suggests that partitioning a set defines a natural equivalence relation.
      Combining this with our observations in the previous section and you should be starting to believe that
      <em>partitions and equivalence relations are essentially the same thing.</em>
      Before we prove this important fact,
      here are some further examples of partitions.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_cong">
      <statement>
        <p>
          \item The integers can be partitioned according to their remainder modulo 3: define
          <me>
            A_r=\{z\in\Z:z\equiv r\tpmod 3\}
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then <m>\Z=A_0\cup A_1\cup A_2</m>.
          This is certainly a partition:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Every integer <m>z</m> has remainder of 0, 1 or 2 after division by 3, and so every integer is in some set <m>A_r</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                No integer has two distinct remainders modulo 3, so the sets <m>A_0,A_1,A_2</m> are disjoint.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          \item More generally, if <m>n\in\N</m>,
          then the set of integers <m>\Z</m> is partitioned into <m>n</m> sets <m>A_0,\ldots,A_{n-1}</m> where
          <me>
            A_r=\{z\in\Z:z\equiv r\pmod n\}
          </me>
          is the set of integers with remainder <m>r</m> upon dividing by <m>n</m>.
          We are appealing to the Division Algorithm
          (<xref ref="thm_div">Theorem</xref>)
          which tells us that every integer <m>z</m> has a
          <em>unique remainder</em>
          <m>r\in\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}</m>. \item The set of real numbers <m>\R</m> is partitioned into the sets of rational and irrational numbers:
          <m>\R=\Q\cup(\R\setminus\Q)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Finally, here is an example of a relation which doesn't produce a partition.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_partnot">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>X=\{1,2,3,4\}</m> and define a relation <m>\cR</m> on <m>X</m> by
          <me>
            \cR=\{(1,3),(1,4),(2,2),(2,3),(3,1),(3,2),(4,3),(4,4)\}
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also define the subsets
          <me>
            A_n=\{x\in X:(n,x)\in\cR\}
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus <m>A_n</m> is the set of all elements of <m>X</m> which are related to <m>n</m>.
          We quickly see that
          <me>
            A_1=\{3,4\}, A_2=\{2,3\}, A_3=\{1,2\}, A_4=\{3,4\}
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The collection of sets <m>A_n</m> is as follows:
          <me>
            \{A_n\}_{n\in X}=\bigl\{A_1,A_2,A_3,A_4\bigr\}=\Bigl\{\{3,4\},\{2,3\},\{1,2\}\Bigr\}
          </me>,
          where we only have <em>three</em>
          sets in the collection since <m>A_4=A_1</m>.
          This collection is not a partition because, for instance,
          <m>2\in \{2,3\}\cap\{1,2\}</m>.
          In the language of <xref ref="defn_partition">Definition</xref>, we have
          <me>
            \{2,3\}\neq\{1,2\}\text{ but }  \{2,3\}\cap\{1,2\}\neq\emptyset
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          More importantly, you should convince yourself that <m>\cR</m> is
          <em>not</em> an equivalence relation.
        </p>
      </statement>

    <title>Equivalence Relations and Partitions</title>
    <p>
      Before we present the fundamental result of the chapter,
      we prove a helpful lemma.
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="lemm_preequiv">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose that <m>\sim</m> is an equivalence relation.
          Then <m>x\sim y\iff [x]=[y]</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <proof>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <title><m>(\Leftarrow)</m></title>
          <p>
            <nbsp/><nbsp/> By reflexivity, <m>x\in[x]</m>.
            If <m>[x]=[y]</m>, then we have <m>x\in[y]</m>.
            Finally, recalling <xref ref="defn_equivrel">Definition</xref>,
            we see that that this is the same as saying <m>x\sim y</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title><m>(\Rightarrow)</m></title>
          <p>
            <nbsp/><nbsp/> Suppose that <m>x\sim y</m>.
            We begin by showing the inclusion <m>[x]\subseteq [y]</m>.
            Let <m>z\in[x]</m>, then
            <me>
              z\sim x\ \text{ and } \ x\sim y\implies z\sim y\implies z\in[y].\tag{(Transitivity)}
            </me>
            Therefore <m>[x]\subseteq[y]</m>.
            By symmetry, we also have <m>y\sim x</m>:
            repeating the argument yields <m>[y]\subseteq [x]</m>,
            and thus <m>[x]=[y]</m>.\qedhere

    <p>
      Some things to consider while reading the proof:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Think about the picture!
            The result is nothing more than the notion of partitioning a cake by cutting it into slices.
            The slices are the equivalence classes of the obvious relation:
            two crumbs are related if and only if they lie in the same slice.
            The algebra that follows merely confirms that the picture is telling a legitimate story.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In part 1.<nbsp/>of the proof,
            look for where the reflexive,
            symmetric and transitive assumptions about <m>\sim</m> are used.
            Why do we need <m>\sim</m> to be an equivalence relation?
            Why does the proof fail if any of the three assumptions are dropped?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Similarly, in part 2., look for where we use both parts of the definition of partition.
            Why are both assumptions required?
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <proof>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Assume that <m>\sim</m> is an equivalence relation on <m>X</m>.
            To prove that the equivalence classes of <m>\sim</m> partition <m>X</m>,
            we must show two things:
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  That every element of <m>X</m> is in some equivalence class.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  That the distinct equivalence classes are pairwise disjoint:
                  if <m>[x]\neq[y]</m>, then <m>[x]\cap[y]=\emptyset</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          For (a), we only need reflexivity:
          <m>\forall x\in X</m> we have <m>x\sim x</m>.
          Otherwise said, <m>x\in[x]</m>,
          whence every element of <m>X</m> is in the equivalence class defined by itself.
          For (b), we prove by the contrapositive method and show that <m>[x]\cap [y]\neq\emptyset\implies [x]=[y]</m>.
          Assume that <m>[x]\cap [y]\neq\emptyset</m>.
          Then <m>\exists z\in [x]\cap [y]</m>.
          This gives
          <md>
            <mrow>z\sim x\ \text{ and } \ z\sim y\amp \implies x\sim z\ \text{ and } \ z\sim y\tag{(Symmetry)}</mrow>
            <mrow>* \amp \implies x\sim y\tag{(Transitivity)}</mrow>
            <mrow>* \amp \implies [x]=[y]\tag{(<xref ref="lemm_preequiv">Lemma</xref>)}</mrow>
          </md>
          We have proved (b) and therefore part 1.<nbsp/>of the theorem.
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Now suppose that <m>\{A_n:n\in I\}</m> is a partition of <m>X</m> and define <m>\sim</m> by
            <me>
              x\sim y\iff \exists n\in I\text{ such that \(x\in A_n\) and \(y\in A_n\). }
            </me>
            We must prove the reflexivity,
            symmetry and transitivity of <m>\sim</m>.  \makebox[\wd\mybox][l]{<em>Reflexivity</em>}  Every <m>x\in X</m> is in some <m>A_n</m>.
            Thus <m>x\sim x</m> for all <m>x\in X</m>.  \makebox[\wd\mybox][l]{<em>Symmetry</em>}  If <m>x\sim y</m>,
            then <m>\exists n\in I</m> such that <m>x,y\in A_n</m>.
            But then <m>y,x\in A_n</m> and so <m>y\sim x</m>.  \makebox[\wd\mybox][l]{<em>Transitivity</em>}  Let <m>x\sim y</m> and <m>y\sim z</m>.
            Then <m>\exists p,q\in I</m> such that
            <m>x,y\in A_p</m> and <m>y,z\in A_q</m>.
            Since <m>\{A_n:n\in I\}</m> is a partition and <m>y\in A_p\cap A_q</m>,
            we necessarily have <m>A_p=A_q</m>.
            Thus <m>x,z\in A_p</m> and so <m>x\sim z</m>.
            We have shown <m>\sim</m> is an equivalence relation,
            and the proof is complete.\qedhere
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </proof>
    <p>
      Reading the proof carefully,
      you should see that reflexivity in part 2.<nbsp/>comes from the fact that <m>X=\bigcup\limits_{n\in I}A_n</m>,
      while transitivity is due to the pairwise disjointness of the pieces of the partition.
      Symmetry is essentially free because the definition of <m>\sim</m> is symmetric in <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ability to partition sets and view the resulting subsets as individual objects is crucial to advanced mathematics.
      The importance of the Theorem comes from the fact that equivalence relations provide a straightforward <em>algebraic</em>
      method of working with partitions.

    <title>Geometric Examples</title>
    <p>
      The language of equivalence relations and partitions is used heavily in geometry and topology to describe complex shapes.
      We finish this section with several examples.
      Since examples of partitions are especially easy to visualize with curves in the plane,
      we first return to the example on <xref ref="ex_equivcircle">page</xref>
      and describe things in our new language.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For each real number <m>r\ge 0</m>, define the set
        </p>
        <sidebyside>
          <me>
            A_r=\bigl\{(x,y)\in\R^2:x^2+y^2=r^2\bigr\}
          </me>.
          This is simply the circle of radius <m>r</m> centered at the origin. We check that <m>\{A_r:r\in\R^+_0\}</m> is a partition of <m>\R^2</m>.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Every point of the plane lies on some circle.
                Precisely, <m>(x,y)\in A_{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}</m> since
                <m>\sqrt{x^2+y^2}</m> is the distance of <m>(x,y)</m> from the origin.
                Thus \smash{<m>\R^2=\bigcup\limits_{r\in\R^+_0}A_r</m>.}
              </p>

                then the concentric circles <m>A_{r_1}</m> and <m>A_{r_2}</m> do not intersect.

        </p>
        <p>
          By <xref ref="thm_equivpart">Theorem</xref>
          this is an equivalence relation.
          We can also check explicitly:
          dropping any mention of the radius <m>r</m>, we see that
          <me>
            (x,y)\sim(v,w)\iff x^2+y^2=v^2+w^2
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is exactly the equivalence relation described on <xref ref="ex_equivcircle">page</xref>.
          The equivalence classes are precisely the sets <m>A_r</m>.
          Indeed for a given point <m>(v,w)</m>,
          <me>
            [(v,w)]=\{(x,y)\in\R^2:x^2+y^2=v^2+w^2\}=A_{\sqrt{v^2+w^2}}
          </me>
          is just the circle of radius <m>\sqrt{v^2+w^2}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      \paragraph{The M&#xf6;bius Strip}
    </p>
    <p>
      Take a rectangle, for example <m>X=[0,6]\times[0,1]</m>,
      and partition into the following subsets.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            If a point does not lie on the left or right edge of the rectangle,
            place it in a subset by itself:
            <m>\{(x,y)\}</m> for <m>x\neq 0,6</m>,
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If a point does lie on the left or right edge of the rectangle,
            place it in a subset with one point from the other edge:
            <m>\{(0,y),(6,1-y)\}</m> for any <m>y</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The rectangle is drawn below,
      where the points on the left and right edges are colored red.
      The arrows indicate how the edges are paired up.
      For example the point <m>(0,0.8)</m>
      (high on the left near the tip of the arrow)
      is paired with <m>(6,0.2)</m>
      (low on the right edge of the rectangle).
    </p>
    <p>
      These subsets clearly partition the rectangle <m>X</m>.
      The partitions define an equivalence relation <m>\sim</m> on <m>X</m> in accordance with <xref ref="thm_equivpart">Theorem</xref>.
      Note that there are infinitely many equivalence classes.
      The question is how we should interpret the quotient set <m>\quotient X\sim</m>?
    </p>
    <p>
      This is easier to visualize than you might think.
      Since each point on the left edge of the rectangle lies in an equivalence class with a point on the right edge,
      we imagine gluing the two edges together in such a way that the corresponding points touch.
      In the picture, we imagine holding <m>X</m> like a strip of paper,
      giving it a twist, and then gluing the edges together.
      This is the classic construction of a M&#xf6;bius strip.
      The advantage of the quotient set calculation is that it is very easy to work with points in the original rectangle.
      As long as you permanently assume that equivalent points of the rectangle correspond to the same point of the M&#xf6;bius strip you can easily work only in the rectangle.

      \paragraph{The Cylinder} We could construct a cylinder similarly to the M&#xf6;bius strip,
      by identifying edges of the rectangle but
      <em>without</em> applying the half-twist.
      Instead we do something a little different.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>X=\R^2</m> with equivalence relation <m>\sim</m> defined by
      <me>
        (a,b)\sim (c,d)\iff a-c\in\Z\textit{{and}} b=d
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The equivalence classes are horizontal strings of points with the same <m>y</m> co-ordinate.
      If we imagine wrapping <m>\R^2</m> repeatedly around a cylinder of circumference 1, all of the points in a given equivalence class will now line up.
      The set of equivalence classes
      <m>\quotient{\R^2}\sim</m> can therefore be visualized as a cylinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively,
      you may imagine piercing a roll of toilet paper and unrolling it.
      The single puncture now becomes a row of (almost!<fn>
      Unfortunately for the analogy,
      toilet paper has purposeful thickness!
      </fn>) equally spaced holes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the picture, the left hand side is
      (part of)
      the plane <m>\R^2</m>,
      displayed so that points in each equivalence class have the same height and color.
      The three horizontal dots all lie in the same equivalence class.
      When we roll up the plane,
      all three points end up at the same point on the cylinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      <image width="80%" source="relations-13-cylinder"/>
    </p>
    <p>
      More complex shapes can be created by other partitions/relations.
      If you want a challenge in visualization,
      consider why the equivalence relation
      <me>
        (a,b)\sim (c,d)\iff a-c\in\Z\textit{{and}} b-d\in\Z
      </me>
      on <m>\R^2</m> defines a torus
      (the surface of a ring-doughnut).

          <em>Where would you cut the defining rectangle and how can you tell that you still have one piece?</em>

          (Hard!) A <em>Klein bottle</em>
          can be visualized as follows.
          Define an equivalence relation <m>\sim</m> on the unit square <m>X=[0,1]\times[0,1]</m> so that:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>(0,y)\sim (1,y)</m> for <m>0\le y\le 1</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>(x,0)\sim(1-x,1)</m> for <m>0\le x\le 1</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        The result is the picture:
        the blue edges are identified in the same direction and the red edges in the opposite.
        Attempting to visualize this in 3D requires a willingness to stretch and distort the square,
        but results in the green bottle.
        The original red and blue arrows have become curves on the bottle.
        If you are using Acrobat Reader,
        click on the bottle and move it around.

              Suppose you cut the Klein bottle along the horizontal dashed line of the defining square.
              What is the resulting object?
              What happens to the green bottle?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Now cut the square along the vertical dashed line.
              What do you get this time?
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        Can you visualize where the two dashed lines are on the green bottle? \end{minipage}
