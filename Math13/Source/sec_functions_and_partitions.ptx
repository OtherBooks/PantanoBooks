  <title>Functions and Partitions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      To complete our discussion of partitions and equivalence relations,
      we consider how to define a function whose domain is a set of equivalence classes.
      We take congruence as our motivating example.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose we want to define a function <m>f:\Z_4\to\Z_6</m>.
      Say <m>f(x)=3x\pmod 6</m>.
      This certainly looks like a function, but is it?
      Remember that <sq><m>x</m></sq> and <sq><m>3x</m></sq> are really equivalence classes,
      so we should say<fn>
      The notation <m>[x]_4</m> is helpful for reminding us which equivalence relation is being applied.
      When dealing with functions between different quotient sets,
      it is easy to become confused.
      </fn>
      <me>
        f\bigl([x]_4\bigr)=[3x]_6,\qquad\text{ where }  [x]_4\in\Z_4\text{ and }  [3x]_6\in\Z_6
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is <em>this</em> a function?
      To make sure, we need to check that <em>any</em>
      representative <m>a\in[x]_4</m> gives the same result.
      That is, we need to prove that
      <me>
        a\equiv b\tpmod 4\implies 3a\equiv 3b\tpmod 6
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not so hard:
      <md>
        <mrow>a\equiv b\tpmod 4\amp \implies \exists n\in\Z\text{ such that } a=b+4n</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp \implies 3a=3b+12n\implies 3a\equiv 3b\tpmod 6</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might appear to be a minor difference,
      but attempting to define <m>g:\Z_4\to\Z_6</m> by <m>g(x)=2x\pmod 6</m> does
      <em>not</em> result in a function.
      If it were, then we should have
      <me>
        a\equiv b\tpmod 4\implies 2a\equiv 2b\tpmod 6
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this is simply not true:
      for example <m>4\equiv 0\pmod 4</m>,
      but <m>8\not\equiv 0\pmod 6</m>.
      It might look like <m>g</m> is a function,
      but it is not well-defined because <m>[4]=[0]</m> in <m>\Z_4</m> and <m>g\bigl([4]\bigr)\neq g\bigl([0]\bigr)</m> in <m>\Z_6</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as in <xref ref="defn_well">Definition</xref>,
      the process of verifying that a rule really is a function is called checking
      <em>well-definition.</em> In general,
      if we are defining a function
      <me>
        f:\quotient X\sim\to A
      </me>
      whose domain is a quotient set,
      then it is usually necessary to construct <m>f</m> by saying what happens to a <em>representative</em>
      <m>x</m> of an equivalence class <m>[x]</m>:
      <me>
        f\bigl([x]\bigr)=\text{ `do something to \(x\)'. } \tag{(\(\ast\))}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      We need to make sure that the <sq>something</sq> is
      <em>independent of the choice of element</em> <m>x</m>.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose that <m>f:\quotient X\sim\to A</m> is a rule of the form
          (<m>\ast</m>).
          We say that <m>f</m> is a <term>well-defined</term> function if
          <me>
            [x]=[y]\implies f\bigl([x]\bigr)=f\bigl([y]\bigr)
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      If you think carefully,
      this is nothing more than condition 2.<nbsp/>of <xref ref="defn_func">Definition</xref>.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          \item Show that <m>f:\Z_n\to\Z_n</m> defined by <m>f([x])=[x^2+4]</m> is well-defined.
        </p>
        <p>
          We must check that <m>x\equiv y\pmod n\implies x^2+4\equiv y^2+4\pmod n</m>.
          But this is trivial! \item For which integers <m>k</m> is the rule <m>f_k:\Z_4\to\Z_6</m> defined by
          <m>f_k([x]_4)=[kx]_6</m> a well-defined function?
        </p>
        <p>
          We start with a special case.
          If <m>k=1</m>,
          then we can attempt to construct a table of values for <m>f_1([x]_4)</m>:
          <me>
            \begin{array}{c|cccc|cccc|cc} [x]_4 \amp  [0]_4 \amp  [1]_4 \amp  [2]_4 \amp  [3]_4 \amp  [4]_4 \amp  [5]_4 \amp  [6]_4 \amp  [7]_4 \amp  [8]_4 \amp  \cdots\\\hline f_1([x]_4) \amp  [0]_6 \amp  [1]_6 \amp  [2]_6 \amp  [3]_6 \amp  [4]_6 \amp  [5]_6 \amp  [0]_6 \amp  [1]_6 \amp  [2]_6 \amp  \cdots \end{array}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The problem is immediately visible!
          In <m>\Z_4</m> we have <m>[0]_4 = [4]_4</m>,
          however <m>f_1([0]_4) = [0]_6</m> and <m>f_1([4]_4) = [4]_6</m>
          <em>which are not equal in <m>\Z_6</m></em>!
          It follows that <m>f_1</m> is not a function.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rather than try out all possible values of <m>k</m>,
          we proceed systematically.
          If <m>f_k</m> is to be well-defined,
          we require <m>x\equiv y\pmod 4\implies kx\equiv ky\pmod 6</m>.
          Now
          <md>
            <mrow>x\equiv y\pmod 4\amp \implies \exists n\in\Z\text{ such that } x-y=4n</mrow>
            <mrow>* \amp \implies kx-ky=4kn</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For <m>f_k</m> to be well-defined,
          we need to see that <m>k(x-y)=4kn</m> is a multiple of 6 <em>independently</em>
          of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
          Thus <m>f_k</m> is well-defined if and only if <m>6\divides 4kn</m><nbsp/>
          <em>for all</em> <m>n\in\Z</m>.
          This is the case if and only if <m>6\divides 4k</m>.
          Otherwise said,
          <me>
            \text{ \(f_k\) is well-defined } \iff 6\divides 4k\iff 3\divides 2k\iff 3\divides k
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Given that we want <m>[kx]_6\in\Z_6</m>,
          we need only consider <m>k\in\{0,1,2,3,4,5\}</m>:
          equivalent values of <m>k</m> modulo 6 won't change the definition of <m>f_k</m>.
          It follows that there are only <em>two</em>
          well-defined functions <m>f_k:\Z_4\to\Z_6:x\mapsto kx</m>,
          namely <m>f_0([x]_4) = [0]_6</m> and <m>f_3([x]_4) = [3x]_6</m>.
          Here they are in tabular form (dropping the brackets):
          <me>
            \begin{array}{c|cccc|cccc|cc} x\amp 0\amp 1\amp 2\amp 3\amp 4\amp 5\amp 6\amp 7\amp 8\amp \cdots\\\hline f_0(x)\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp \cdots\\\hline f_3(x)\amp 0\amp 3\amp 0\amp 3\amp 0\amp 3\amp 0\amp 3\amp 0\amp \cdots \end{array}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          It should be clear that well-defined functions <m>f_k</m> produce tables whose <m>f_k(x)</m> line is
          <em>periodic with period four.</em> To ram this point home,
          here is the table when <m>k=5</m>:
          <me>
            \begin{array}{c|cccc|cccc|cc} x\amp 0\amp 1\amp 2\amp 3\amp 4\amp 5\amp 6\amp 7\amp 8\amp \cdots\\\hline f_5(x)\amp 0\amp 5\amp 4\amp 3\amp 2\amp 1\amp 0\amp 5\amp 4\amp \cdots \end{array}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          This is palpably not a function!
          You should compare these examples with those on <xref ref="ex_functmod1">page</xref>
          and with <xref ref="sec_func1">Exercise</xref>.
          <xref ref="ex_kfunc"></xref>.
          Are these earlier example still functions when the domains are assumed to be a ring <m>\Z_n</m> rather than simply a set of integers?
        </p>
      </statement>

  </introduction>
  <subsection xml:id="subsec_cylinder">
    <title>Functions on the Cylinder and Torus</title>
    <p>
      Recall our construction on <xref ref="page_cylinder">page</xref>,
      where we viewed the cylinder as the set
      <m>\quotient{\R^2}\sim</m> with respect to the equivalence relation
      <me>
        (a,b)\sim (c,d)\iff a-c\in\Z\text{ and }  b=d
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We wish to define a function <m>f</m> whose domain is a cylinder.
      Using the equivalence relation,
      this is the same as defining a function
      <m>f:\quotient{\R^2}\sim\to A</m> where <m>A</m> is our chosen codomain.
      <em>Well-definition</em> requires that <m>f</m> satisfy
      <me>
        (a,b)\sim(c,d)\implies \smash{f\Bigl(\bigl[(a,b)\bigr]\Bigr)=f\Bigl(\bigl[(c,d)\bigr]\Bigr).}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Since <m>(a,b)\sim(a+1,b)</m>,
      we require <m>f\Bigl(\bigl[(a,b)\bigr]\Bigr)=f\Bigl(\bigl[(a+1,b)\bigr]\Bigr)</m>,
      for all <m>a,b\in\R</m>.
      Otherwise said,
      <m>f\Bigl(\bigl[(x,y)\bigr]\Bigr)</m> must be periodic in <m>x</m> with period one.
      It is easy to see that
      <me>
        \smash{f\Bigl(\bigl[(x,y)\bigr]\Bigr)=y^2\sin(2\pi x)}
      </me>
      is a suitable choice of function <m>f:\quotient{\R^2}\sim\to\R</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      More generally, to define a function whose domain is the torus
      <me>
        T^2=\quotient{\R^2}\sim\text{ where }  (a,b)\sim (c,d)\iff a-c\in\Z\text{ and }  b-d\in\Z
      </me>,
      requires a function which is periodic in
      <em>both</em> <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
      The function
      <me>
        f\Bigl(\bigl[(x,y)\bigr]\Bigr)=\sin(2\pi x)\cos(2\pi y)
      </me>
      is plotted below,
      with the color on the torus indicating the value of <m>f</m>.
      It is easier to instead consider the function
      <me>
        F:\R^2\to\R:(x,y)\mapsto\sin(2\pi x)\cos(2\pi y)
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is also plotted, with the same color for each value.
      The point is that <m>F</m> is really <m>f</m> in disguise,
      but has the advantage of being much easier to work with.

      </p>

    The proof, like much of mathematics, is a masterpiece in concision that seems to be doing nothing at all. The point is that functions of the form <m>f:\quotient X\sim\to A</m> are <em>difficult</em> to work with. The Theorem says that we never need to explicitly use such functions, and can instead work with <em>simpler</em> functions of the form <m>F:X\to A</m>. The only condition is that we must have <m>x\sim y\implies F(x)=F(y)</m>. Essentially, <m>F</m> is <m>f</m> in disguise!
