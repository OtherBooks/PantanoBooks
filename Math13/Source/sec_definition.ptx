  <title>Definition</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Mathematicians spend a lot of time proving theorems <mdash/> stating truths and providing justification.
      True statements about what?
      Well <xref ref="thm_pythagorean">Theorem</xref>
      seems to be a statement about right triangles.
      What are those?
      Whatever it is,
      it had better satisfy the following <em>definition</em>,
      a set of unambiguous and clear conditions.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A right triangle is a triangle,
          two of whose sides meet at a right angle.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      It seems like we've cheated a bit here.
      This doesn't make any sense until we've also defined
      <q>triangle</q>,
      <q>right angle</q>, and
      <q>side</q>
      as well.
      How deep does the rabbit hole go?
      Well a triangle is a polygon with three sides and a right angle is exactly half of a straight angle.
      Now it looks like we have to define
      <q>polygon</q>
      and
      <q>straight angle.</q>
      We can keep defining objects in terms of other ideas,
      but at some point we have to stop and say
      <q>you know what I mean.<fn>
      The ancient Greek geometer Euclid left some pretty fundamental terms like
      <q>point</q>
      and
      <q>line</q>
      undefined by modern standards.
      Instead of saying
      <q>you know what I mean,</q>
      a point was
      <q>that which has no part</q>
      and a line was
      <q>a length without width.</q>
      </fn></q>
    </p>
    <p>
      In a way, definitions serve as the foundation upon which we construct buildings <mdash/> theorems in this analogy.
      Let's walk through some other examples,
      this time from number theory.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          An integer is even if it is divisible by two.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      For now we'll take
      <q>the integers</q>
      to be the set of positive and negative whole numbers and zero <m>\Z = \{\ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots \}</m>.
      If we really wanted to,
      we could come up with definitions for <m>0</m>, <m>1</m>,
      and so on, but we'll take these for granted here.<fn>
      The use of <m>\Z</m> for the set of integers comes from the German word for
      <q>number</q>,
      <q>zahlen</q>. The branch of math that would be concerned with defining the integers in terms of more primitive objects would be mathematical logic and set theory.
      </fn> Assuming we know what
      <q>integer</q>
      and
      <q>two</q>
      are, it looks like we need to define
      <q>divisible.</q>
      This shouldn't give us too much trouble,
      assuming that we know how to do basic arithmetic like addition and multiplication of integers.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          An integer <m>a</m> is divisible by the integer <m>b</m> if <m>a = bc</m> for some integer <m>c</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      So for example, <m>2</m> itself is even since <m>2 = 2\cdot 1</m>.
      So is <m>-50 = 2\cdot (-25)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only once we have our definitions straight can we start proving things.
      For example, consider the following theorem:
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm_even_sum">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The sum of any two even integers is even.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      The proof of this theorem flows straight from the definition.
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> be <em>any</em> two even integers.
        We want to show that <m>x+y</m> is an even integer.
      </p>
      <p>
        By definition,
        an integer is even if it can be written in the form <m>2k</m> for some integer <m>k</m>.
        Thus there exist integers <m>n</m>,
        <m>m</m> such that <m>x=2m</m> and <m>y=2n</m>.
        We compute:
        <me>
          x+y = 2m+2n = 2(m+n).\tag{(\(\ast\))}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Because <m>m+n</m> is an integer,
        this shows that <m>x+y</m> is an even integer.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      There are several important observations:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <sq>Any</sq> in the statement of the theorem means the proof must work <em>regardless</em>
            of what even integers you choose.
            It is not good enough to simply select,
            for example, 4 and 16, then write <m>4+16=20</m>.
            This is an <em>example,</em> or test,
            of the theorem, not a mathematical proof.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            According to the definition,
            <m>2m</m> and <m>2n</m> together represent
            <em>all possible pairs</em> of even numbers.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The proof makes direct reference to the definition.
            The vast majority of the proofs in this course are of this type.
            If you know the definition of every word in the statement of a theorem,
            you will often discover a proof simply by writing down the definitions.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The theorem itself did not mention any <em>variables.</em>
            The proof required a calculation for which these were essential.
            In this case the variables <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> come for free
            <em>once you write the definition of evenness!</em>
            A great mistake is to think that the proof is nothing more than the calculation
            (<m>\ast</m>).
            This is the easy bit,
            and it means nothing without the surrounding sentences.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The important link between theorems and definitions is much of what learning higher-level mathematics is about.
      We prove theorems
      (and solve homework problems)
      because they make us use and understand the subtleties of definitions.
      One does not <em>know</em> mathematics, one <em>does</em> it.
      Mathematics is a <em>practice;</em>
      an art as much as it is a science.

          Let's say an integer to be
          <q>nearly a square</q>
          if it is of the form:
          <me>
            2=2\cdot 1,  6= 3\cdot 2,  12=4\cdot 3,  20=5\cdot 4,  30=6\cdot 5, 42=7\cdot 6,\dots

          The following are <em>incorrect</em>
          ways of writing the definition of an <term>odd integer</term>.
