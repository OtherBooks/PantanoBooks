  <title>Proof by Induction</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The previous section motivated the need for induction and helped us see where induction fits into a logical investigation.
      In this section we formally lay out several induction proofs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Induction is the mathematical equivalent of a domino rally;
      toppling the <m>n</m>th domino causes the <m>(n+1)</m>th domino to fall,
      hence to knock all the dominos over it is enough merely to topple the first.
      Instead of dominoes,
      in mathematics we consider a sequence of <em>propositions:</em>
      <m>P(1),\ P(2),\ P(3)</m>, etc.
      Induction demonstrates the truth of <em>every</em>
      proposition <m>P(n)</m> by doing two things:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Proving that <m>P(1)</m> is true(<em>Base Case</em>)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Proving that <m>\forall n\in\N \, \ P(n)\implies P(n+1)</m> is true(<em>Induction Step</em>)
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      You could think of the base case as knocking over the first domino,
      and the induction step as the <m>n</m>th domino knocking over the <m>(n+1)</m>th,
      <em>for all <m>n</m>.</em> Both of the examples in the previous section followed this pattern.<fn>
      In the cut-and-stack example,
      the initial proposition would be labelled <m>P(0)</m> rather than <m>P(1)</m>.
      </fn> Unpacking the induction step gives an infinite chain of implications:
      <me>
        P(1)\implies P(2)\implies P(3)\implies P(4)\implies P(5)\implies \cdots
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The base case says that <m>P(1)</m> is true,
      and so <em>all</em> of the remaining propositions <m>P(2),\ P(3),\ P(4),\ P(5),\ldots</m> are also true.
    </p>
    <p>
      All induction proofs have the same formal structure:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ndash/><ndash/>THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED<ndash/><ndash/><ndash/><ndash/>
    </p>
    <p>
      (<em>Induction Step</em>)
    </p>
    <p>
      (<em>Set-up</em>)Define the propositional function <m>P(n)</m>,
      set-up notation and orient the reader as to what you are about to prove.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<em>Base Case</em>)
    </p>
    <p>
      Prove that <m>P(1)</m> is true.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<em>Induction Step</em>)
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>n\in\N</m> be fixed and assume that <m>P(n)</m> is true.
      This assumption is the <term>induction hypothesis</term>.
      Perform calculations or other reasoning to conclude that <m>P(n+1)</m> is true.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<em>Conclusion</em>)
    </p>
    <p>
      Remind the reader what it is that you have proved.
    </p>
    <p>
      <ndash/><ndash/><ndash/><ndash/><ndash/><ndash/><ndash/>-
    </p>
    <p>
      As you read more mathematics,
      you will find that the induction step is typically the most involved part of the proof.
      The <em>set-up</em> stage is often no more than a sentence:
      <sq>We prove by induction,</sq> and the explicit definition of <m>P(n)</m> is commonly omitted.
      These are the only shortcuts that it is sensible to take until you are extremely comfortable with induction.
      Practice making it completely clear what you are doing at each juncture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is a straightforward theorem,
      where we write the proof in the above language.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm_ind1">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The sum of the first <m>n</m> positive integers is given by the formula
          <me>
            \sum_{i=1}^ni=\frac 12n(n+1)
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        (<em>Set-up</em>)We prove by induction.
        For each <m>n\in\N</m>, let <m>P(n)</m> be the proposition
        <me>
          \sum_{i=1}^ni=\frac 12n(n+1)
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        (<em>Base Case</em>)Clearly \smash[t]{<m>\sum\limits_{i=1}^1i=1=\frac 121(1+1)</m>,} and so <m>P(1)</m> is true.
      </p>
      <p>
        (<em>Induction Step</em>)Assume that <m>P(n)</m> is true for some fixed <m>n\ge 1</m>.
        We compute the sum of the first <m>n+1</m> positive integers using our induction hypothesis <m>P(n)</m> to simplify:
        <md>
          <mrow>\sum_{i=1}^{n+1}i\amp =(n+1)+\sum_{i=1}^ni=(n+1)+\frac 12n(n+1)\tag{(by assumption of $P(n)$)}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =\left(1+\frac 12n\right)(n+1)=\frac 12(n+2)(n+1)</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =\frac 12(n+1)\bigl[(n+1)+1\bigr]</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This last says that <m>P(n+1)</m> is true.
      </p>
      <p>
        (<em>Conclusion</em>)By mathematical induction,
        we conclude that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n\in\N</m>.
        That is
        <md>
          <mrow>\forall n\in\N, \sum\limits_{i=1}^ni=\frac 12n(n+1)</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      Note how we grouped <m>\frac 12(n+1)\bigl[(n+1)+1\bigr]</m> so that it is obviously the right hand side of <m>P(n+1)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is another example in the same vein, but done a little faster.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm_ind2">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Prove that <m>n(n+1)(2n+1)</m> is divisible by 6 for all natural numbers <m>n</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We prove by induction.
        For each <m>n\in\N</m>, let <m>P(n)</m> be the proposition
        <me>
          \text{ \(n(n+1)(2n+1)\) is divisible by 6. }
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        (<em>Base Case</em>)Clearly
        <m>1\cdot (1+1)\cdot (2\cdot 1+1)=6</m> is divisible by 6, hence <m>P(1)</m> is true.
      </p>
      <p>
        (<em>Induction Step</em>)Assume that <m>P(n)</m> is true for some fixed <m>n\in\N</m>.
        Then
        <me>
          n(n+1)(2n+1)=6k
        </me>
        for some <m>k\in\Z</m>.
        But now we have
        <md>
          <mrow>(n+1)(n+2)\bigl[2(n+1)+1\bigr]-n(n+1)(2n+1)\amp =(n+1)\bigl[(n+2)(2n+3)-n(2n+1)\bigr]</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =(n+1)(2n^2+7n+6-2n^2-n)</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =6(n+1)^2</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the induction hypothesis, we have that
        <me>
          (n+1)(n+2)\bigl[2(n+1)+1\bigr]=n(n+1)(2n+1)+6(n+1)^2=6(k+(n+1)^2)
        </me>
        is divisible by 6.
        Thus <m>P(n+1)</m> is true.
        By mathematical induction, <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n\in\N</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      <xref ref="thm_ind2">Theorem</xref> is also true for <m>n=0</m>,
      and indeed for <em>all</em> integers <m>n</m>.
      As we shall see in the next section,
      induction works perfectly well with any base case (say <m>n=0</m>):
      you are not tied to <m>n=1</m>.
      We could even modify the argument to prove the same result when <m>n</m> is a negative integer!
    </p>
    <p>
      After reading the proof, you are possibly thinking,
      <sq>How would I know to do that calculation?</sq> The answer is that you wouldn't, at least not without
      <em>experience reading proofs.</em>
      It is better to think on how much scratch work was done before the originator stumbled on exactly this argument.
      Read more proofs and practice writing them,
      and you'll soon find that strategies like these will suggest themselves!
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is another example, written in a more advanced style:
      we don't explicitly name the propositions <m>P(n)</m>,
      and the reader is expected to be familiar enough with induction to realize when we are covering the base case and the induction step.
      If you find reading this proof a challenge,
      you should rewrite it in the same style as we used previously.
      Some assistance in this regard is given below.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm_ind3">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For all <m>n\in\N</m>, <m>2+5+8+\cdots+(3n-1)=\frac 12n(3n+1)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        For <m>n=1</m> we have <m>2=2</m>,
        hence the proposition holds.
        Now suppose that the proposition holds for some fixed <m>n\in\N</m>.
        Then
        <md>
          <mrow>2+5+\cdots+[3(n+1)-1]\amp =\left[2+5+\cdots+(3n-1)\right]+3n+2</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =\frac 12n(3n+1)+3n+2=\frac 12(3n^2+7n+4)</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =\frac 12(n+1)(3n+4)=\frac 12(n+1)\bigl[3(n+1)+1\bigr]</mrow>
        </md>
        which says that the proposition holds for <m>n+1</m>.
        By mathematical induction the proposition holds for all <m>n\in\N</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      This last example has a different flavor than the ones we have seen so far.
      The example concerns a <m>2^n \times 2^n</m> board of squares.
      By an <term>L-shaped tromino</term>,
      we mean three squares arranged in an
      <q>L</q>
      shape
      (though possibly flipped or rotated).
      For example, the following are examples of L-shaped trominoes:
      <image width="73%" source="induction-08-bluetromino"/> <image width="73%" source="induction-07-greentromino"/> <image width="73%" source="induction-09-yellowtromino"/> <image width="73%" source="induction-10-redtromino"/>
    </p>
    <p>
      The result is that if one takes any
      <m>2^n \times 2^n</m> board and removes any one square,
      the rest of the board may be tiled by L-shaped triominoes.
      Here is an example of the <m>4 \times 4</m> case:
      <image width="73%" source="induction-11-tilingexample"/>
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>n \in \N</m>.
          Then any <m>2^n \times 2^n</m> board of squares may be tiled by L-shaped trominoes after removing any square.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We proceed by induction on <m>n</m>.
        For <m>n = 1</m>, we look at a <m>2 \times 2</m> board.
        It should be clear that no matter which of the four squares we choose to exclude,
        the remaining three squares form an L-shaped tromino
        (if you are unsure, try to draw the board).
      </p>
      <p>
        Now fix <m>n \in \N</m> and suppose that given a
        <m>2^n \times 2^n</m> board and <em>any</em>
        choice of one of the squares to exclude,
        we can tile the rest of the board with trominoes.
        Now take a <m>2^{n+1} \times 2^{n+1}</m> board and pick an arbitrary square to remove.
        Divide the board into four quadrants <m>Q_1,Q_2,Q_3,Q_4</m>,
        where each of which are boards of size <m>2^n \times 2^n</m>.
        The removed square must lie in one of these quadrants,
        without loss of generality say it is in quadrant <m>Q_1</m>.
        By the induction hypothesis,
        it is possible to tile <m>Q_1</m> minus the removed square by trominoes.
        Now consider the other three quadrants and choose one corner of each.
        Again by the induction hypothesis,
        it is possible to tile each of these quandrants with the chosen corner removed by trominoes.
        Finally, rotate the three remaining quadrants so that their chosen corners lie adjacent in the center of the board.
        These removed corners now form an L-shaped tromino,
        and can thus be covered by one more tromino.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      \paragraph{Scratch work is your friend!}
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you are comfortable with the structure of an induction proof,
      the challenge is often in finding a clear argument for the induction step.
      Don't dive straight into the proof!
      First try some scratch calculations.
      Be creative,
      since the same approach will not work for all proofs.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the benefits of explicitly stating <m>P(n)</m> is that it helps you to isolate what you know and to identify your goal.
      When stuck, write down both expressions <m>P(n)</m> and <m>P(n+1)</m> and you will often see how to proceed.
      Consider, for example, the proof of <xref ref="thm_ind3">Theorem</xref>.
      We have:
      <md>
        <mrow>\begin{array}{@{}l@{}l} P(n):\amp \displaystyle 2+5+8+\cdots+(3n-1)=\frac 12n(3n+1).\\[-1pt] P(n+1): \amp \displaystyle 2+5+8+\cdots+[3(n+1)-1]=\frac 12(n+1)\bigl[3(n+1)+1\bigr] \end{array}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Simply by writing these down,
      we know that our goal is to somehow convert the left hand side of <m>P(n+1)</m> into the right hand side,
      using <m>P(n)</m>.
      In this situation it is clear how to proceed,
      for almost all of the left hand side of <m>P(n+1)</m> can be substituted for that of <m>P(n)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a final comment on scratch work,
      remember that such is <em>very unlikely</em> to constitute a proof.
      Here is a typical attempt at a proof of <xref ref="thm_ind3">Theorem</xref>
      by someone who is new to induction.
    </p>
    <proof>
      <md>
        <mrow>P(n+1)=\amp \amp \underbrace{2+5+\cdots+(3n-1)}_{=\frac 12n(3n+1)\text{ by } P(n)}+[3(n+1)-1]\amp =\frac 12(n+1)\bigl[3(n+1)+1\bigr]</mrow>
        <mrow>[-15pt]
        \amp \amp \amp =\frac 12(n+1)(3n+4)</mrow>
        <mrow>\implies\amp \amp \frac 32n^2+\frac 12n+3n+3-1\amp =\frac 12(3n^2+7n+4)</mrow>
        <mrow>\implies\amp \amp \frac 32n^2+\frac 72n+2\amp =\frac 32n^2+\frac 72n+2</mrow>
      </md>
    </proof>
    <p>
      Such an approach is likely to score very poorly in an exam!
      Here are some of the reasons why.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>P(n+1)</m> is the <em>goal,</em>
          the conclusion of the induction step.
          You cannot prove <m>\timplies{P(n)}{P(n+1)}</m> by
          <em>starting</em> with <m>P(n+1)</m>!
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>P(n+1)</m> is a <em>proposition</em>
          and <m>2 + 5 + \cdots + (3n - 1) + [3(n+1) - 1]</m> is a <em>number</em>,
          thus it makes no sense to write that they are equal!
          Use words or another symbol to disambiguate the two.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          More subtly:
          the false proof's argument says that something we don't know (<m>P(n)\wedge P(n+1)</m>) implies something true
          (the trivial final line).
          Since the implications <m>\timplies TT</m> and <m>\timplies FT</m> are both true
          (<xref ref="defn_implies">Definition</xref>),
          this tells us <em>nothing</em> about whether <m>P(n+1)</m> is true.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Reversing the arrows and turning the false proof upside down would be a start.
          However there is no explanation as to <em>why</em>
          the calculation is being done.
          The induction step is only part of an induction proof and it needs to be placed and explained in context.
          More concretely:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              There is no set-up.
              <m>P(n)</m> has not been defined,
              neither indeed has <m>n</m>.
              You cannot use the expression <m>P(n)</m>
              (or any other symbols)
              in a proof unless it has been properly defined.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The base case is missing.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              There is no conclusion.
              Indeed the word <em>induction</em> isn't mentioned:
              is the reader supposed to guess that we're doing induction?!
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For all this negativity, there are some good things here.
      If you remove the <m>\Longrightarrow</m> symbols,
      you are left with an excellent piece of scratch work.
      By simplifying both sides of your goal you can more easily see how to calculate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your scratch work may make perfect sense to you,
      but if a reader cannot follow it without your assistance,
      then it isn't a proof.
      The moral of the story is to do your scratch work for the induction step <em>then</em>
      lay out the structure of the proof (set-up, base case,
      etc.) before incorporating your calculation into a coherent and convincing argument.

          <q>proof</q>
          by induction of the statement
          <q>all cats have the same color fur</q>.
          <proof>
            <p>
              We let <m>P(n)</m> be the proposition
              <q>any set of <m>n</m> cats have the same color fur</q>. The result will follow if we prove that <m>P(n)</m> holds for all <m>n \in \N</m>.
              We proceed by induction on <m>n</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is clear that the base case <m>n = 1</m> holds as any cat has the same color fur as itself.
              For the induction step, fix
              <m>n \in \N</m> and assume <m>P(n)</m> holds.
              Take any set <m>S = \{C_1,C_2,\ldots,C_{n+1}\}</m> of <m>n + 1</m> cats.
              Select one cat, say <m>C_1</m>, and put it aside.
              Now we have a set <m>S \setminus \{C_1\}</m> of <m>n</m> cats and by the induction hypothesis they must all have the same color fur.
              Now put <m>C_1</m> back select a different cat <m>C_2</m>.
              Again by the induction hypothesis,
              all cats in <m>S \setminus \{C_2\}</m> must have the same color fur.
              But combining this with the previous sentence means that all cats in <m>S</m> must have the same color fur.
              Since <m>S</m> was an arbitrary set of <m>n + 1</m> cats,
              this shows <m>P(n+1)</m> holds.
              We conclude that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m> by induction.
