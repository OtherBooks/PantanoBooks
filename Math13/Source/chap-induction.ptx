  <title>Mathematical Induction and Well-ordering</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="sec_proof">Section</xref>
      we discussed three methods of proof:
      direct, contrapositive, and contradiction.
      The fourth standard method of proof,
      <em>induction,</em> has a very different flavor.
      In practice it formalizes the idea of spotting a pattern.
      Before we give the formal definition of induction,
      we consider where induction fits into the investigative process.
