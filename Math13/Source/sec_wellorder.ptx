  <title>Well-ordering and the Principle of Mathematical Induction</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Before seeing more examples,
      it is worth thinking more carefully about the logic behind induction.
      The fact that induction really works depends on a fundamental property of the natural numbers.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="defn_wellorder">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A set of real numbers <m>A</m> is <term>well-ordered</term>
          if every non-empty subset of <m>A</m> has a minimum element.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The definition is delicate: to test if a set <m>A</m> is well-ordered,
      we need to check <em>all</em> of its non-empty subsets.
      The definition could be written as follows:
      <me>
        \forall B\subseteq A\text{ such that } B\neq\emptyset,\ \text{ we have that \(\min(B)\) exists. }
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Consequently, to show that a set <m>A</m> is
      <em>not</em> well-ordered,
      we need only exhibit a non-empty subset <m>B</m> which has <em>no minimum.</em>
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          \item <m>A=\{4,-7,\pi,19,\ln 2\}</m> is a well-ordered set.
          There are 31 non-empty subsets of <m>A</m>,
          each of which has a minimum element.
          Can you justify this fact <em>without</em>
          listing the subsets? \item The interval <m>[3,10)</m> is not well-ordered.
          Indeed <m>(3,4)</m> is a non-empty subset which has no minimum element
          (see the exercises). \item The integers <m>\Z</m> are not well-ordered.
          For instance, <m>\Z</m> is a non-empty subset of itself,
          and there is no minimum integer.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      More generally,
      every finite set of numbers is well-ordered, while intervals are not.
      Are there any <em>infinite</em>
      sets which are also well-ordered?
      The answer is <em>yes.</em> Indeed it is part of the standard definition (Peano's Axioms) of the natural numbers that <m>\N</m> is such a set.
    </p>
    <axiom>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <m>\N</m> is well-ordered.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </axiom>
    <p>
      Any set that <sq>looks like</sq> <m>\N</m> is automatically well-ordered.<fn>
      When the elements are written in increasing order,
      the set has the form <m>B=\{b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4,\ldots\}</m>.
      </fn> For example
      <me>
        B=\left\{0,\frac 12,\frac 23,\frac 34,\frac 45,\ldots\right\}=\left\{\frac n{n+1}:n\in\N\right\}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Armed with this axiom, we can justify the method of proof by induction.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm_ind">
      <title>Principle of Mathematical Induction</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>P(n)</m> be a proposition for each <m>n\in\N</m>.
          Suppose:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <title>(a)</title>
              <p>
                <m>P(1)</m> is true.

            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          Then <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n\in\N</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We argue by contradiction.
        Assume that conditions (a) and (b) hold and that
        <m>\exists n\in\N</m> such that <m>P(n)</m> is
        <em>false.</em> Then the set
        <me>
          S:=\{k\in\N:P(k)\text{ is false } \}
        </me>
        is a non-empty subset of the well-ordered set <m>\N</m>.
        It follows that <m>S</m> has a minimum element
        <me>
          m:=\min(S)
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that <m>P(m)</m> is <em>false.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        By condition (a), <m>P(1)</m> is true, and so <m>m\neq 1</m>.
        Therefore <m>m\ge 2</m> from which we see that <m>m-1\in\N</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>m=\min(S)</m> it follows that
        <m>m-1\not\in S</m> and so <m>P(m-1)</m> must be <em>true.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        However, by condition (b),
        we see that <m>P(m-1)\implies P(m)</m>,
        whence <m>P(m)</m> is <em>true.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a contradiction.
        In addition to properties (a) and (b),
        our only assumption was that <em>at least one</em>
        proposition <m>P(n)</m> was false,
        therefore this is what we have contradicted.
        We conclude that conclude that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n\in\N</m>.
      </p>

  <subsection>
    <title>Different Base Cases for Induction</title>
    <p>
      An induction argument need not begin with the case <m>n=1</m>.
      By proving <xref ref="thm_ind">Theorem</xref>
      it should be clear where we used the well-ordering of <m>\N</m> in order to justify induction.
      Now fix an integer <m>m</m> (positive,
      negative or zero) and consider the set
      <me>
        \Z_{\ge m}=\{n\in\Z:n\ge m\}=\{m,m+1,m+2,m+3,\ldots\}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This set is well-ordered,
      whence the following modification of the induction principle is immediate.
    </p>
    <corollary>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>m\in\Z</m> be some fixed integer.
          Let <m>P(n)</m> be a proposition for each integer <m>n\ge m</m>.
          Suppose:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <title>(a)</title>
              <p>
                <m>P(m)</m> is true.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <title>(b)</title>
              <p>
                <m>\forall n\ge m \, P(n)\implies P(n+1)</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          Then <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n\ge m</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </corollary>
    <p>
      We are simply changing the base case.
      The induction concept is exactly the same as before:
      <me>
        P(m)\implies P(m+1)\implies P(m+2)\implies P(m+3)\implies\cdots
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      As long as you explicitly prove the first claim in the sequence,
      and you show the induction step,
      then all the propositions are true.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is an example where the induction argument begins with <m>m=4</m>.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For all integers <m>n\ge 4</m>, we have <m>3^n>n^3</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        (<em>Base Case</em>)If <m>n=4</m>,
        we have <m>3^n=81>64=n^3</m>.
        The proposition is therefore true for <m>n=4</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        (<em>Induction Step</em>)Fix
        <m>n\in\Z_{\ge 4}</m> and suppose that <m>3^n>n^3</m>.
        Then
        <me>
          3^{n+1}=3\cdot 3^n>3n^3
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To finish the proof,
        we want to see that this right hand side is at least <m>(n+1)^3</m>.
        Now
        <me>
          3n^3\ge(n+1)^3\iff 3\ge\left(1+\frac 1n\right)^3
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is true for <m>n=3</m> and,
        since the right hand side is decreasing as <m>n</m> increases,
        it is certainly true when <m>n\ge 4</m>.
        We therefore conclude, for <m>n\ge 4</m>, that
        <me>
          3^n>n^3\implies 3^{n+1}>(n+1)^3
        </me>
        which is the induction step.
        By induction,
        we have shown that <m>3^n>n^3</m> whenever <m>n\in\Z_{\ge 4}</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      Our next example is reminiscent of sequences and series from elementary calculus.
      If you follow a textbook derivation of such a formula,
      you'll probably see liberal use of ellipsis dots
      (<m>\ldots</m>).
      When you see these,
      it is often because the author is hiding an induction argument.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For all integers <m>n\ge 3</m>, we have
          <me>
            \sum\limits_{i=3}^n\frac 1{i(i-2)}=\frac 34-\frac{2n-1}{2n(n-1)}.\tag{(\(\ast\))}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        (<em>Base Case</em>)When <m>n=3</m>, (<m>\ast</m>) reads <m>\sum\limits_{i=3}^3\frac 1{i(i-2)}=\frac 34-\frac 5{12}</m>.
        Both sides equal <m>\frac 13</m>,
        whence <m>(\ast)</m> is true.
      </p>
      <p>
        (<em>Induction Step</em>)Assume that (<m>\ast</m>) is true for some fixed <m>n\ge 3</m>.
        Then
        <md>
          <mrow>\sum_{i=3}^{n+1}\frac 1{i(i-2)}\amp =\sum_{i=3}^{n}\frac 1{i(i-2)}+\frac 1{(n+1)(n-1)}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =\frac 34-\frac{2n-1}{2n(n-1)}+\frac 1{(n+1)(n-1)}\tag{(\emph{by the induction hypothesis})}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =\frac 34-\left[\frac{(2n-1)(n+1)-2n}{2(n+1)n(n-1)}\right]=\frac 34-\left[\frac{1+n-2n^2}{2(n+1)n(n-1)}\right]</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =\frac 34+\frac{(2n+1)(1-n)}{2(n+1)n(n-1)}=\frac 34-\frac{2n+1}{2(n+1)n}</mrow>
        </md>
        which is exactly (<m>\ast</m>) when <m>n</m> is replaced by <m>n+1</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        By induction (<m>\ast</m>) holds for all integers <m>n\ge 3</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      A calculus discussion would finish by taking the limit as
      <m>n\to\infty</m> to conclude that <m>\sum\limits_{i=3}^\infty\frac 1{i(i-2)}=\frac 34</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our final example involves a little abstraction.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm_polygon">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The interior angles of an <m>n</m>-gon (<m>n</m>-sided polygon) sum to <m>180(n-2)</m> degrees.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      We will take the initial case (<m>n=3</m>) that the angles of a triangle sum to 180\textdegree<nbsp/>as given
      (can you prove it?)
      and merely prove the induction step.
      The main logical difficulty is that we must consider <em>all</em>
      <m>n</m>-gons simultaneously.
      If we were to write the induction step in the form
      <me>
        \forall n\in\Z_{\ge 3},\ P(n)\implies P(n+1)
      </me>,
      then the proposition <m>P(n)</m> would be
      <me>
        P(n): \forall n\text{ -gons } \cP_n,\text{ the sum of the interior angles of \(\cP_n\) is \(180(n-2)\)\textdegree. }
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      To prove our induction step for a
      <em>fixed</em> integer <m>n</m>,
      we must show that <em>all</em> <m>(n+1)</m>-gons have the correct sum of interior angles.
      We therefore assume that we are given some <m>(n+1)</m>-gon
      <m>\cP_{n+1}</m> and proceed to compute its interior angles in terms of a related <m>n</m>-gon.
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Fix an integer <m>n\ge 3</m>,
        and suppose that <em>all</em> <m>n</m>-gons have interior angles summing to <m>180(n-2)</m>\textdegree.
        Suppose we are given an <m>(n+1)</m>-gon <m>\cP_{n+1}</m>.
        Select any vertex <m>A</m> and label the adjacent vertices <m>B</m> and <m>C</m>.
        Delete <m>A</m>,
        and join <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> with a straight edge.
        The result is an <m>n</m>-gon <m>\cP_n</m>.
        There are two cases to consider.\footnotemark[\value{footnote}]

The sum of the interior angles of \(\mathcal{P}_{n+1}\) exceeds those of \(P_n\) by \(\alpha+\beta+\gamma=180\)\textdegree. Therefore \(\mathcal{P}_{n+1}\) has interior angles summing to \(180(n-2)\text{ \textdegree } +180\text{ \textdegree } =180[(n+1)-2]\)\textdegree.\\[-5pt]  Case 2: The deleted point \(A\) is \emph{inside} \(\mathcal{P}_n\). To obtain the sum of the interior angles of \(\mathcal{P}_{n+1}\), we take the sum of the interior angles of \(\mathcal{P}_n\) and do three things:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <em>Subtract</em> \(\beta\)

  <subsection>
    <title>Optional: Density of the Rationals</title>
    <p>
      In our last example,
      we offer a more direct application of <m>\N</m> being well-ordered.
      One of the key properties of the rational numbers <m>\Q</m> is their density in the real line.
      Intuitively,
      the idea is that no matter how close you "zoom in" on the real line,
      you can always locate a rational number.
      We formalize this with the following definition.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          We say a set <m>A \subseteq \R</m> is <term>dense</term>
          (in <m>\R</m>)
          if for any real numbers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> such that <m>x \lt y</m>,
          there is <m>a \in A</m> such that <m>x \lt a \lt y</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      So if you take two real numbers,
      you can always find an element from <m>A</m> in between them,
      no matter how close the two real numbers are from each other.
      Our goal will be to prove that the rational numbers <m>\Q</m> are dense in <m>\R</m>.
      For this, we will use the well-orderedness of <m>\N</m> along with the following:
    </p>
    <axiom>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The real numbers <m>\R</m> have the
          <term>Archimedean property</term>, that is,
          for any real numbers <m>x,y > 0</m>,
          there is <m>n \in \N</m> such that <m>nx > y</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </axiom>
    <p>
      It is not really necessary to take this as an axiom as the Archimedean property of <m>\R</m> can be proved from more basic principles.
      However, this requires some knowledge about how to construct the real numbers which lies beyond the scope of this course.
      Back to our goal,
      we need the following lemma which states that if two real numbers differ by more than <m>1</m>,
      then there must be an integer between them.
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="lemm_rationaldensityprep">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose we have <m>x,y \in \R</m> with <m>y - x > 1</m>.
          Then there exists <m>k \in \Z</m> such that <m>x \lt k \lt y</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <proof>
      <p>
        The idea is to take <m>k</m> to be the least integer greater than <m>x</m>.
        We will show such an integer exists using the fact that <m>\N</m> is well-ordered.
        Let <m>A = \{n \in \Z : n > x\}</m>.
        Then <m>A \neq \emptyset</m> by the Archimedean property
        (why?).
        Let <m>m \in \Z</m> be a number such that <m>m \lt  x</m>
        (this is another application of the Archimedean property),
        and thus <m>m \lt  n</m> for all <m>n \in A</m>,
        by definition of <m>A</m>.
        Let
        <me>
          S = \{n - m + 1 : n \in A\}
        </me>.

      <p>
        So <m>S \subseteq \N</m> and since <m>A \neq \emptyset</m>,
        we have <m>S \neq \emptyset</m>.
        Since <m>\N</m> is well-ordered,
        <m>S</m> has a minimum element <m>s</m>.
        Then <m>k = s + m - 1</m> is the minimum element of <m>A</m>
        (why?).
      </p>
      <p>
        By definition <m>x \lt k</m>.
        But by minimality of <m>k</m>,
        <m>k - 1 \notin A</m>, i.e., <m>x \geq k - 1</m>.
        Thus <m>x \lt k \leq x + 1</m>.
        Finally, since <m>y - x > 1</m>,
        we have <m>x + 1 \lt y</m>.
        All together, <m>x \lt k \leq x + 1 \lt y</m>.
        So <m>k</m> is as required.

      Now we can prove our main result.

    <theorem>
      <statement>

          The rational numbers <m>\Q</m> are dense in <m>\R</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>x,y \in \R</m> with <m>x \lt y</m> be arbitrary.
        We need to find <m>r \in \Q</m> with <m>x \lt r \lt y</m>.
        Then <m>y - x > 0</m>.
        By the Archimedean property,
        there is <m>n \in \N</m> such that <m>n(y - x) > 1</m>.
        Since <m>ny - nx > 1</m>,
        we can apply <xref ref="lemm_rationaldensityprep">Lemma</xref>
        to get <m>k \in \Z</m> such that <m>nx \lt k \lt ny</m>.
        As <m>n \geq 1 > 0</m>, dividing yields <m>x \lt \frac{k}{n} \lt y</m>.
        Take <m>r = \frac{k}{n} \in \Q</m>.

        <term>Well-ordering more generally</term>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well-ordering is a fundamental concept whose implications are far beyond what we're discussing here.
        Informally speaking, <em>well-ordering</em>
        a set <m>A</m> involves listing the elements of <m>A</m> in some order so that every non-empty subset of <m>A</m> has a first element
        <em>with respect to that order.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider, for example, the set of negative integers <m>\Z^-</m>.
        For the purposes of these notes we will always consider the standard ordering:
        <me>
          \cdots\lt -4\lt -3\lt -2\lt -1
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Written in the standard order,
        <m>\Z^-=\{\ldots,-4,-3,-2,-1\}</m> is
        <em>not</em> a well-ordered set.
        In a more advanced discussion,
        one could consider alternative orderings,
        and the definition of well-ordered would change accordingly.
        If we choose the ordering <m>\prec</m> where
        <me>
          -1 \prec -2 \prec -3 \prec \cdots,\tag{\(\ast\)}
        </me>
        then <m>\Z^-</m> would be well-ordered using <m>\prec</m> as the order:
        if <m>B\subseteq\Z^-</m> is non-empty and has its elements listed in the same order as <m>(\ast)</m>,
        then <m>B</m> has a minimum element
        (with respect to <m>\prec</m>).
        With a little thinking,
        we could modify the proof of the principle of mathematical induction to allow us to prove theorems of the form <m>\forall n\in\Z^-,\ P(n)</m>,
        by induction.
        The base case is <m>n=-1</m> and the induction step justifies the chain
        <me>
          P(-1)\implies P(-2)\implies P(-3)\implies\cdots
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        An extremely important theorem in advanced set theory states that it is possible to well-order <em>every</em> set.
        With a slight modification of the process,
        this massively increases the applicability of induction.
        In these notes we keep things simple:
        well-ordering is always in the sense of <xref ref="defn_wellorder">Definition</xref>,
        where we list the elements of a set in the usual increasing order.
        For a more esoteric example of a well-ordered set,
        see the final Exercise below.

          In the text,
          we show that the principle of mathematical induction can be proved using the axiom that <m>\N</m> is well-ordered.
          In fact we show in this exercise that one can go the other way.
          That is, one can take the principle of mathematical induction as an axiom,
          and derive that <m>\N</m> is well-ordered.

                Assume that the principle of mathematical induction is true.
                We aim to show that <m>\N</m> is well-ordered.
                Write out what this means.

                Explain why it is enough to show that if

          We consider Peano's five axioms for the natural numbers:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <title>Initial element:</title>
            <p>
              <nbsp/><nbsp/> <m>1\in\N</m>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title>Successor elements:</title>
            <p>
              <nbsp/><nbsp/> There is a <em>successor function</em> <m>f:\N\to\N</m>.
              For each <m>n\in\N</m>,
              the successor <m>f(n)</m> is also a natural number.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title>No predecessor of the initial element:</title>
            <p>
              <nbsp/><nbsp/> <m>\forall n\in\N</m>, <m>f(n)=1</m> is false.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title>Unique predecessor:</title>
            <p>
              <nbsp/><nbsp/> <m>f</m> is injective:
              <m>f(n)=f(m)\implies m=n</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title>Induction:</title>
            <p>
              <nbsp/><nbsp/> If <m>A\subseteq\N</m> has the following properties:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <m>1\in A</m>,
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <m>\forall a\in A</m>, <m>f(a)\in A</m>,
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            then <m>A=\N</m>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        The successor function <m>f</m> is simply <sq>plus one</sq> in disguise:
        <m>f(n)=n+1</m>.
        Moreover, if you think carefully about the proof of <xref ref="thm_ind">Theorem</xref>,
        you should be convinced that the <em>induction</em>
        axiom is equivalent to the axiom that <m>\N</m> is well-ordered,
        at least in the presence of the other four axioms.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Suppose you replace <m>\N</m> with <m>\Z</m> in each of the above axioms.
              Which axioms are still true and which are false?

              Let <m>f:T\to T</m> be the function <m>f(m,n)=(m+1,n)</m>.
              Letting the pair <m>(1,1)</m> play the role of <sq>1</sq> in Peano's axioms,

              (Hard!) With the same set <m>T</m> as in part (b),
              take the successor function <m>f:T\to T</m> to be

          (Hard!) You might assume from our earlier discussion that all well-ordered sets must look like the natural numbers.
          To disabuse you of this error, consider the set
          <me>
            B=\left\{0,\frac 12,\frac 23,\frac 34,\frac 45,\ldots,1,\frac 32,\frac 53,\frac 74,\frac 95,\ldots\right\}=\left\{\frac n{n+1}:n\in\N\right\}\cup\left\{\frac{2n-1}{n}:n\in\N\right\}
          </me>
          Prove that <m>B</m> is well-ordered.<fn>
          The principle of mathematical induction does not apply to propositions indexed by this set.
          The reason is that <sq>1</sq> is not a successor element in <m>B</m>:
          there is no element <m>b\in B</m> such that 1 is <sq>the element after <m>b</m>.</sq> Happily,
          there is a more general notion of
          <em>transfinite induction</em>
          which extends induction to propositions indexed by well-ordered sets like <m>B</m>.
          Transfinite induction proofs require an additional step in order to deal with
          <em>limit elements</em> like <m>1\in B</m>.
          </fn>  <em>Hint: If <m>C\subseteq B</m> is non-empty,
          consider the cases where <m>\exists c\lt 1</m> and when all <m>c\ge 1</m> separately.</em>
