  <title>Well-definition, Rings and Congruence</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We return to our discussion of congruence
      (recall <xref ref="sec_cong">Section</xref>)
      in the context of equivalence relations and partitions.
      The important observation is that
      <em>congruence modulo <m>n</m> is an equivalence relation on <m>\Z</m>,</em>
      each equivalence class being the set of all integers sharing a remainder modulo <m>n</m>.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm_congequiv1">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For a fixed <m>n\in\N</m>, define <m>x\sim_n y\iff x\equiv y\pmod n</m>.
          Then <m>\sim_n</m> is an equivalence relation on <m>\Z</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      The theorem is a restatement of <xref ref="ex_cong">Example</xref>
      on <xref ref="ex_cong">page</xref>,
      in conjunction with <xref ref="thm_equivpart">Theorem</xref>.
      You should prove this yourself,
      as practice in using the definition of equivalence relation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The equivalence classes are precisely those integers which are congruent modulo <m>n</m>:
      the integers which share the same remainder.

      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      In this language,
      we can restate what it means for two equivalence classes to be equal.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm_congequiv2">
      <statement>
        <p>
          <m>[a]=[b]\iff a\equiv b\pmod n\iff \exists k\in\Z\text{ such that } b=a+kn</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      If the meaning of <em>any</em> of the above is unclear,
      re-read the previous two sections:
      they are critically important!
    </p>
    <p>
      The equivalence classes of <m>\sim_n</m> partition the integers <m>\Z</m>.
      According to <xref ref="thm_congequiv2">Theorem</xref>,
      there are exactly <m>n</m> equivalence classes,
      whence we may describe the quotient set as
      <me>
        \quotient \Z{\sim_n}=\big\{[0],[1],\ldots,[n-1]\big\}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use this set to define an extremely important object.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Define operations <m>+_n</m> and <m>\cdot_n</m> on the set <m>\quotient\Z{\sim_n}</m> as follows:
          <me>
            [x]+_n[y]:=[x+y],\qquad [x]\cdot_n[y]:=[x\cdot y]
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <term>ring</term> <m>\Z_n</m> is the set
          <m>\quotient\Z{\sim_n}</m> together with the operations <m>+_n</m> and <m>\cdot_n</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The operation <m>+_n</m> is telling us how to add
      <em>equivalence classes,</em> that is,
      how to produce a new equivalence class from two old ones.
      It is important to understand that <m>+_n</m> is
      <em>not the same</em> operation as <m>+</m>:
      we are <em>defining</em> <m>+_n</m> using <m>+</m>.
      The former combines equivalence classes,
      while the latter sums integers.
      The operation <m>\cdot_n</m> similarly tells us how to multiply equivalence classes.
      The challenge here is that you have to think of each equivalence class as a single object.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          When we write
          <me>
            [3]+_8[6]=[3+6]=[9]=[1]
          </me>,
          we are thinking about the equivalence classes <m>[3]</m> and <m>[6]</m> as individual objects rather than as collections of elements:
          remember that <m>[3]=\{\ldots,-5,3,11,19,\ldots\}</m> is an infinite set!
          There is, moreover, a matter of choice:
          since, for example, <m>[3]=[11]</m> and
          <m>[6]=[22]</m> we should be able to observe that
          <me>
            [3]+_8[6]=[11]+_8[22]
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is this true?
          If not, then the operation <m>+_8</m> would not be particularly useful.
          Thankfully this is not a problem:
          according to the definition of <m>+_8</m>, we have
          <me>
            [11]+_8[22]=[11+22]=[33]=[1]
          </me>,
          exactly as we would wish.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Let us think a little more abstractly.
      Suppose we are given equivalence classes <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m>,
      how do we compute <m>X+_nY</m>?
      Here is the process.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Choose</em> elements <m>x\in X</m> and <m>y\in Y</m> so that <m>X=[x]</m> and <m>Y=[y]</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Add <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> to get a new element <m>x+y\in\Z</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Then <m>X+_nY</m> is the equivalence class <m>[x+y]</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      The issue is that there are <em>infinitely many possibilities</em>
      for the elements <m>x\in X</m> and <m>y\in Y</m> chosen at step 1.
      If <m>+_n</m> is to make sense,
      we must obtain the <em>same</em>
      equivalence class <m>[x+y]</m> <term>regardless of our choices of <m>x\in X</m> and <m>y\in Y</m>.</term>
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="defn_well">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A concept is <term>well-defined</term>
          if it is <term>independent of all choices used in the definition.</term>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <theorem xml:id="thm_congwd">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The operations <m>+_n</m> and <m>\cdot_n</m> are well-defined.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      The choices made in the definitions of <m>+_n</m> and <m>\cdot_n</m> were of representative elements <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> of the equivalence classes <m>[x]</m> and <m>[y]</m>.
      All representatives of these classes have the form
      <me>
        x+kn\in[x]\text{ and }  y+ln\in[y]
      </me>
      for some integers <m>k,l</m>.
      It therefore suffices to prove that
      <me>
        \forall k,l\in\Z, [x+kn]+_n[y+ln]=[x]+_n[y]\text{ and }  [x+kn]\cdot_n[y+ln]=[x]\cdot_n[y]
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are now in a position to prove the Theorem.
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We prove that <m>+_n</m> is well-defined.
        <md>
          <mrow>+_n[y+ln]\amp =[(x+kn)+(y+ln)]\tag{(by definition of $+_n$)}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =[x+y+(k+l)n]</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =[x+y]\tag{(by <xref ref="thm_congequiv2">Theorem</xref>)}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =[x]+_n[y]\tag{(by definition of $+_n$)}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        The argument for <m>\cdot_n</m> is similar.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      You should re-read <xref ref="thm_congbasic">Theorem</xref>
      until you are comfortable that we are doing the same thing!
    </p>

      <p>
        <term>Aside: Ugly notation</term>
      </p>
      <p>
        Given the usefulness of <m>\Z_n</m> and the cumbersome nature of the above notation,
        it is customary to drop the square brackets and subscripts and simply write
        <me>
          \Z_n=\{0,1,2,\ldots,n-1\},\qquad x+y:=x+y\tpmod n,\qquad x\cdot y:=xy\tpmod n
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When using this description of <m>\Z_n</m>,
        you should realize that we are working with equivalence classes,
        not numbers.
        In this context, <m>-3\in\Z_8</m> makes perfect sense,
        for it really means <m>[-3]\in\Z_8</m>.
        This is perfectly fine, since
        <m>[-3]=[5]</m> as equivalence classes,
        whence it is legitimate to write <m>-3=5</m> in <m>\Z_8</m>.
        Until you are 100% sure that you know when 3 represents an equivalence class and when it represents a number,
        you should keep the brackets in place:
        in particular it might be a good idea to keep using them until you have passed <em>this course</em>!
