  <title>Propositional Functions and Quantifiers</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      While the logic of propositions from Section 2.1 is a fairly straightforward place to start our explorations,
      it is not powerful enough to express the majority of statements one encounters when actually doing mathematics.
      For one, it lacks the ability to deal with <em>variables</em>,
      which are of central importance in mathematics.
      For example, the expressions
      <q>17 is a prime number greater than 2</q>,
      <q>5 is a prime number greater than 2</q>, and
      <q>32 is a prime number greater than 2</q>
      are really just three instances of the same thing.
      Namely
      <q><m>x</m> is a prime number greater than 2</q>
      with <m>17</m>, <m>2</m>,
      and <m>32</m> plugged in for <m>x</m>, respectively.
      In propositional logic, however,
      these three would constitute three wholly different propositions,
      obscuring their relationship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, propositional logic fails to capture standard patterns of argument which we wish to consider.
      Consider propositions <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>.
      If we know that <m>P \implies Q</m> is true,
      and we know <m>P</m> is true,
      then we <em>must</em> conclude that <m>Q</m> is true
      (if you don't believe this, try to prove it yourself!)
      Since this holds no matter what propositions <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> actually are,
      we call this a <em>valid argument</em>.
      On the other hand,
      an argument of the form <m>P</m> is true, <m>Q</m> is true,
      therefore <m>R</m> is true is not valid as it could be the case that <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are true and <m>R</m> false if you choose <m>P</m>,
      <m>Q</m>,
      and <m>R</m> to be certain statements!
      Now consider the following: All prime numbers greater than 2 are odd.
    </p>
    <p>
      17 is a prime number greater than 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore 17 is odd.
      This is certainly correct reasoning,
      however in propositional logic this argument takes the form of:
      <m>P</m> is true, <m>Q</m> is true,
      therefore <m>R</m> is true.
      But this (1) is not valid and (2) does not capture the true form of the argument.
      A better way to translate this argument would be: All A's are B.
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>x</m> is an A.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore <m>x</m> is a B. It turns out this is a valid argument,
      it does not depend on what <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> actually are.
      To study this in more depth,
      we will need to move beyond propositions to
      <em>propositional functions</em>
      and <em>quantifiers</em>.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>propositional function</term>
          is a family of propositions which depend on one or more variables.
          The collection of objects allowed to be substituted in for variables in a propositional function is its <term>domain</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      For instance if <m>P(x)</m> is a propositional function depending on a single variable <m>x</m>,
      then for each object <m>a</m> in the domain of <m>P</m>,
      <m>P(a)</m> is a proposition.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose that <m>x</m> is allowed to be any real number.
          We could define the propositional function <m>P(x)</m> by <m>x^2>4</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this example <m>P(5)</m> is true,
          whilst <m>P(-1)</m> is false.
          More generally, <m>P(x)</m> is true for some values of <m>x</m>
          (namely <m>x>2</m> or <m>x\lt -2</m>)
          and false for others
          (<m>-2\le x\le 2</m>).
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose that <m>x</m> is allowed to be any integer.
          Define the propositional function <m>P(x)</m> by
          <q><m>x</m> is a prime number</q>
          and <m>Q(x)</m> by
          <q><m>x > 2</m></q>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The expression
          <q><m>x</m> is a prime number greater than 2</q>
          can then be translated as <m>P(x) \land Q(x)</m>.
          Thus <m>P(17) \land Q(17)</m> is true,
          whilst <m>P(2) \land Q(2)</m> and <m>P(32) \land Q(32)</m> are false.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      At the beginning of the section we considered the expression
      <q>All prime numbers greater than 2 are odd</q>. We saw in the example above how to translate
      <q><m>x</m> is a prime number greater than 2</q>
      into logic.
      To translate the rest of the expression, we need to deal with the
      <q>all</q>
      and the
      <q>is odd</q>
      parts.
      Here,
      <q>all</q>
      is an example of a <em>quantifier</em>,
      something that tells us how many things satisfy some propositional function.
      This one is called the <em>universal quantifier</em> as it says everything
      (in the domain)
      satisfies some propositional function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's try to translate
      <q><m>x</m> is odd</q>
      into logic now.
      Recall that a number <m>x</m> is odd if it can be written as <m>2k + 1</m>
      <em>for some</em> integer <m>k</m>.
      In other words <em>there exists</em>
      and integer <m>k</m> such that <m>x = 2k + 1</m>.
      Here we see another type of quantifier,
      the <em>existential quantifier</em>,
      which posits the existence of some
      (at least one)
      thing that satisfies some propositional function.
      The English language has all sorts of quantifiers (all, some,
      many, few,
      etc.) but in mathematics we primarily deal with just two.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>universal quantifier</term>
          is denoted <m>\forall</m>
          (read
          <q>for all</q>
          or
          <q>for every</q>).
        </p>
        <p>
          Let <m>P(x)</m> be a propositional function.
          Then
          <me>
            \forall x \, P(x) \qquad \text{ (read: for all \(x\), \(P(x)\) is true } )
          </me>
          is a proposition which is true if and only if <m>P(x_0)</m> is true for all <m>x_0</m> in the domain of <m>P</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>existential quantifier</term>
          is denoted <m>\exists</m>
          (read
          <q>there exists</q>).
        </p>
        <p>
          Let <m>P(x)</m> be a propositional function.
          Then
          <me>
            \exists x \, P(x)  \qquad \text{ (read: there is an \(x\), such that \(P(x)\) is true } )
          </me>
          is a proposition which is true if and only if there exists some <m>x_0</m> in the domain of <m>P</m> such that <m>P(x_0)</m> is true.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      We pause briefly to introduce some notation to help speed things along.
      We use <m>\N</m> to denote the positive integers,
      <m>\Z</m> the integers, <m>\R</m> the real numbers,
      and <m>\in</m> for <sq>is a member of the set</sq>.
      Thus <m>2\in\Z</m> is read as <sq>2 is a member of the set of integers</sq>,
      or more concisely, <sq>2 is an integer</sq>.
      We will properly cover this notation in <xref ref="chap_sets">Chapter</xref>.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Recall the above example where,
          for each real number <m>x</m>,
          <m>P(x)</m> is the proposition <m>x^2>4</m>.
          Consider the quantified propositions:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>\forall x \, P(x)</m> is <em>false</em>,
                since <m>P(x)</m> is not true for all <m>x\in\R</m>.
                In particular <m>P(-1)</m> is false.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>\exists x \, P(x)</m> is <em>true</em>,
                since there is at least one <m>x\in\R</m> for which <m>P(x)</m> is true,
                namely <m>x=5</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>counterexample</term> to
          <m>\forall x \, P(x)</m> is a single element <m>x_0</m> in the domain of <m>P</m> such that <m>P(x_0)</m> is false.
        </p>
        <p>
          An <term>example</term> of
          <m>\exists x \, P(x)</m> is a single element <m>x_0</m> in the domain of <m>P</m> such that <m>P(x_0)</m> is true.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Clearly <m>x_0 = -1</m> is a counterexample to <m>\forall x \, (x^2>4)</m>,
      while <m>x_0 = 5</m> is an example of <m>\exists x \, (x^2>4)</m>.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Here is a slightly more complicated example with a propositional function with two variables.
          Let <m>R(x,y)</m> be given by
          <m>x = 2y + 1</m> where we agree that <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are to be integers.
          Then <m>\exists y \, R(x,y)</m> asserts that there exists some integer,
          let's call it <m>k</m>, such that <m>x = 2k + 1</m>.
          In other words,
          <m>\exists y \, R(x,y)</m> asserts that <m>x</m> is odd.
          Let <m>O(x)</m> be <m>\exists y \, R(x,y)</m>.
          Note that <m>O(x)</m> is a propositional <em>function</em>.
          It still depends on <m>x</m>!

          As a test to see if you are following along,
          check to make sure the following make sense:

        </p>
        <p>
          Mathematics is filled with compound expressions of this type,
          where quantifiers and propositional functions are combined to create more complicated propositional functions.

  <subsection>
    <title>Two Common Translations</title>
    <p>
      There are two constructions involving quantifiers which are common enough that we point them out here.
      It can be useful to understand the underlying logical structure of statements of the form
      <q>all A's are B's</q>
      and
      <q>there is an A which is a B</q>. The sentences
      <q>all primes greater than 2 are odd</q>
      and
      <q>there exists an odd prime</q>
      are somewhat natural examples of these types of statements.
    </p>
    <remark>
      <p>
        Let <m>P(x)</m> and <m>Q(x)</m> be propositional functions.
        The statement All A's are B's is really a statement of the following form,
        where <m>P(x)</m> is the propositional function
        <q><m>x</m> is an <m>A</m></q>
        and <m>Q(x)</m> is the propositional function
        <q><m>x</m> is a B</q>: Everything which satisfies <m>P(x)</m> also satisfies <m>Q(x)</m> which can be written as
        <me>
          \forall x \, (P(x) \implies Q(x))
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, the statement There is an A which is a B is really There is something satisfying <m>P(x)</m> which also satisfies <m>Q(x)</m> which can be written as
        <me>
          \exists x \, (P(x) \land Q(x))
        </me>.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <q>All humans are mortal</q>
          is written in logic as <m>\forall x \, (P(x) \implies Q(x))</m> where <m>P(x)</m> is
          <q><m>x</m> is a human</q>
          and <m>Q(x)</m> is
          <q><m>x</m> is mortal</q>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          We let <m>P(x)</m> be
          <q><m>x</m> is a prime number</q>, <m>Q(x)</m> be <m>x > 2</m>, and <m>O(x)</m> be
          <q><m>x</m> is odd</q>. Then
          <q>all primes greater than 2 are odd</q>
          can be written as
          <me>
            \forall x \, [(P(x) \land Q(x)) \implies O(x)]
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <q>There is an odd prime</q>
          can be written as
          <me>
            \exists x \, (P(x) \land O(x))
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>

  <subsection>
    <title>Bounded Quantifiers</title>
    <p>
      Often we wish to make explicit the domain of a propositional function which we are quantifying,
      or to restrict our quantifiers to smaller parts of the domain.
      We can accomplish this by the use of
      <em>bounded quantifiers</em>.
      We introduce this via examples.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the statement:
          <q>every real number is a cube</q>. By what we said above, we could translate this into logic as
          <me>
            \forall x \, Q(x)
          </me>
          where <m>Q(x)</m> is
          <q><m>x</m> is a cube</q>
          and has domain the real numbers<fn>
          We could also write this as <m>\forall x \, (P(x) \implies Q(x))</m> where <m>P(x)</m> is
          <q><m>x</m> is a real number</q>.
          </fn>.
          If we want to emphasize that we are quantifying over the real numbers,
          we often write something like
          <me>
            \forall x \in \R \, Q(x)
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In reality, mathematicians rarely write out specific statements using notation like <m>P(x)</m> or <m>Q(x)</m>
          (these letters are usually reserved for standing in for abstract propositional functions).
          In this example,
          <q><m>x</m> is a cube</q>
          can be written as <m>\exists y \in \R \, (x = y^3)</m>.
          So
          <q>every real number is a cube</q>
          is
          <me>
            \forall x \in \R \, \exists y \in \R \, (x = y^3)
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          While the statement
          <q>every real number is a square</q>
          is false, we can make it a true statement by restricting our attention to just
          <em>positive</em> reals:
          <q>every <em>positive</em> real number is a square</q>
          is true.
          We could write this as
          <me>
            \forall x > 0 \, \exists y \in \R  \, (x = y^2)
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, the condition <m>x > 0</m> in the <m>\forall</m> quantifier restricts the quantifier the smaller domain of just those real numbers which are <m>> 0</m>,
          i.e., positive real numbers.
        </p>

        <term>Clarity versus Concision</term>
      </p>
      <p>
        As with all forms of art,
        different practitioners of mathematics have different tastes.
        Some write very concisely, keeping words to a minimum.
        Some write almost entirely in English.
        Some use a hybrid of quantifiers and English,
        aiming for a balance between brevity and clarity.
        For example, consider the famous
        <em>sum of four squares</em> theorem:

        A good rule is to write in sentences,
        replacing words with symbols only when it makes things more readable while simultaneously preserving the flow of the sentence.

    <remark>
      <p>
        In some sense, we don't really need bounded quantifiers.
        For example,
        one can view <m>{\forall x \in \R \, P(x)}</m> as simply shorthand for <m>\forall x \, (x \in \R \implies P(x))</m> and
        <m>\exists x > 0 \, P(x)</m> as shorthand for <m>\exists x (x > 0 \land P(x))</m>.
        This pattern holds in general:
        you can replace a bounded <m>\forall</m> quantifier with an unbounded one by putting the condition at the front of an implication and a bounded <m>\exists</m> quantifier by putting the condition in a conjunction.
      </p>
      <p>
        In practice, however, this can get very messy,
        especially in statements with many quantifiers!
        Getting comfortable with bounded quantifiers can help you write cleaner statements.

    <title>Negating Quantified Propositions</title>
    <p>
      Perhaps the most important skill to have regarding quantifiers
      (in this course)
      is knowing how to negate them.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm_negquant">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any propositional function <m>P(x)</m>, we have:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>\neg(\forall x \, P(x))</m> is logically equivalent to <m>\exists x\, \neg P(x)</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>\neg(\exists x \, P(x))</m> is logically equivalent to <m>\forall x \, \neg P(x)</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      In essence, negation swaps the quantifiers <m>\forall\leftrightarrow\exists</m>.
      Like with all theorems,
      if you want to understand it, you should unpack it,
      write it in English, and come up with some examples.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            The negation of <sq><m>P(x)</m> is true for all <m>x</m></sq> is,
            <sq><m>P(x)</m> is false for some <m>x</m>.</sq>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The negation of <sq><m>P(x)</m> is true for some <m>x</m></sq> is,
            <sq><m>P(x)</m> is always false.</sq>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <paragraphs>
      <title>Examples</title>
      <p>
        Here are two examples,
        numbered corresponding to the parts of <xref ref="thm_negquant">Theorem</xref>.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              The negation of the statement,
              <sq>Everyone owns a bicycle</sq> is:
              <ul>
                <li class="custom-list-style-type">
                  <p>
                    Somebody does not own a bicycle.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            It is extremely pedantic, but symbolically we might write:
            <me>
              \neg\Big[\forall\text{ people } x,\ x\text{ owns a bicycle } \Big]\iff \exists\text{ a person \(x\) such that \(x\) does not own a bicycle }
            </me>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Suppose that <m>x</m> is a real number and consider the quantified proposition:
              <me>
                \exists x\,\text{ such that } \sin x=4
              </me>.
              This has the form <m>\exists x \,P(x)</m>,
              and therefore has negation <m>\forall x \, \neg P(x)</m>.
              Explicitly, the negation is:
              <me>
                \forall x \text{ we have } \sin x\neq 4
              </me>.
              Note how we introduced the words <em>we have</em>
              to make the sentence read more clearly.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </paragraphs>
    <p>
      Once you're comfortable negating simple propositions and quantifiers,
      negating multiple quantifiers is easy.
      Just follow the rules, think, and take your time.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Show that the following statement about the real numbers is false.
          <me>
            \forall x \, \exists y \, \text{ such that } xy=3
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The negation of this expression follows the rules for switching quantifiers and negating the final statement:
          <me>
            \exists x,\, \text{ such that } \forall y \, \text{ we have } xy\neq 3
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is easy to see that the negated statement is true:
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>x=0</m>, then, regardless of <m>y</m>,
            we have <m>xy=0\neq 3</m>.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          Because the negation is true,
          the original statement is false.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      <term>Warning!</term> When negating bounded quantifiers,
      do <term>not</term> change the condition.
      Here is a couple examples to illustrate.
      We leave the reason as to why to not change the condition to the exercises.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              The negation of
              <q>every yellow car has four doors</q>
              is <term>not</term>
              <q>there exists a non-yellow car without four doors</q>. The correct negation is
              <q>there is a yellow car without four doors</q>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Consider the statement
              <q>every positive real number is a square</q>
              which we saw we could write as
              <me>
                \forall x > 0 \, \exists y \in \R \, (x = y^2)
              </me>.
              Note that this is a <em>true</em>
              statement and so its negation must be false.
              So something like
              <me>
                \exists x \leq 0 \, \forall y \in \R \, (x \neq y^2)
              </me>
              could <em>not</em> be the correct negation as this is also a true statement.
              Instead, simply negate the quantifiers as you normally would,
              but leave the condition as is:
              <me>
                \exists x > 0 \, \forall y \in \R \, (x \neq y^2)
              </me>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </statement>

    <title>Advice when Negating: Hidden and Excess Quantifiers</title>
    <p>
      <xref ref="thm_negquant">Theorem</xref>
      seems very simple, but it is easy to misuse.
      Here are some points to consider when negating quantifiers.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Don't forget the <em>meaning</em> of the sentence.
            Use the logical rules in <xref ref="thm_negquant">Theorem</xref>,
            but also think it out in words.
            You should get the same result.
            Think about the finished sentence and read it aloud:
            if it <em>sounds</em> like the opposite of what you started with then it probably is!
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The symbol <m>\nexists</m> for <sq>does not exist</sq> is much abused.
            Very occasionally its use is appropriate,
            but it too often demonstrates laziness or a lack of understanding.
            Avoid using it unless absolutely necessary.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Beware of hidden quantifiers!
            Sometimes a quantifier is not explicitly stated.
            This is especially the case with the universal quantifier and is very common when a statement contains an implication.
            Consider the following very easy theorem.
            <ul>
              <li class="custom-list-style-type">
                <p>
                  If <m>n</m> is an odd integer,
                  then <m>n^2</m> is odd.(<m>\ast</m>)
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          This is really a statement about <em>all</em> integers.
          There is a hidden quantifier that's been suppressed in the interests of readability.
          Instead, the theorem could have been written
          <ul>
            <li class="custom-list-style-type">
              <p>
                <m>\forall n\in\Z</m>
                (<m>n</m> is odd <m>\implies n^2</m> is odd).
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          In this form we can negate by combining the rules in <xref ref="thm_negconditional">Theorems</xref>
          and <xref ref="thm_negquant"></xref>.
          The pattern is
          <me>
            \neg\left[\forall n \, (P(n)\implies Q(n))\right]\text{ is equivalent to }  \exists n \, (P(n) \land \neg Q(n))
          </me>.
          The negation of (<m>\ast</m>) is therefore,
          <ul>
            <li class="custom-list-style-type">
              <p>
                <m>\exists n\in\Z</m> such that <m>n</m> is odd and <m>n^2</m> is even.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          Given that (<m>\ast</m>) is a theorem,
          its negation is, of course, false!
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is a harder example of a hidden quantifier,
      this time from Linear Algebra.
      You do not have to know what a vector is to work with this definition.
      We are purely concerned with how to negate an abstract statement.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Vectors <m>\vx,\vy,\vz</m> are <term>linearly independent</term> if
          <me>
            a\vx+b\vy+c\vz=\V 0\implies a=b=c=0
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The implication is a statement about <em>all</em>
      real numbers <m>a,b,c</m>.
      We could instead have written
      <ul>
        <li class="custom-list-style-type">
          <p>
            <m>\forall a,b,c\in\R\text{ we have } a\vx+b\vy+c\vz=\V 0\implies a=b=c=0</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      To negate the definition, we must also negate the hidden quantifier.
      The result is the definition of what it means for vectors <m>\vx,\vy,\vz</m> to be
      <em>linearly dependent</em>:
      <me>
        \exists a,b,c\text{ not all zero such that } a\vx+b\vy+c\vz=\V 0
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The final challenge here is recalling how to negate an implication:
      recall <xref ref="thm_negconditional">Theorem</xref>,
      and note that the negation of <m>a=b=c=0</m> is that <em>at least one</em>
      of <m>a,b,c</m> is non-zero.

    <title>Putting it all together: the definition of continuity</title>
    <p>
      You might have seen the strict definition of continuity in a calculus class.<fn>
      If not, you will have plenty time to get used to it in an upper-division Analysis course<ellipsis/>
      </fn> It combines multiple quantifiers,
      a hidden quantifier and an implication.
      The purpose of this example isn't to teach you the subtleties of continuity.
      Just as with the linear independence example,
      we simply want to be able to read and negate such expressions.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="defn_cont">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose that <m>f</m> is a function whose domain and codomain are sets of real numbers.
          We say that <m>f</m> is <term>continuous</term> at <m>x=a</m> if,
          <me>
            \forall\ve >0\ \exists\delta>0\text{ such that } |x-a|\lt \delta\implies |f(x)-f(a)|\lt \ve.\tag{(\(\ast\))}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The implication is a statement about <em>all</em>
      real numbers <m>x</m> which satisfy some property,
      so we once again have a hidden quantifier:
      <me>
        \forall\ve>0 \, \exists\delta>0\text{ such that } \underline{\forall x\in\R} \, |x-a|\lt \delta\implies |f(x)-f(a)|\lt \ve
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can now use our rules to state what it means for <m>f</m> to be
      <em>discontinuous</em> at <m>x=a</m>:
      <me>
        \exists\ve>0\text{ such that } \forall\delta>0 \, \exists x\in\R\text{ such that } |x-a|\lt \delta\text{ and } |f(x)-f(a)|\ge\ve
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <term>Warning!</term> Remember,
      the negation of <m>\forall\ve>0</m> is
      <em>not</em> <m>\exists\ve\le 0</m>.
      Only the ultimate proposition<fn>
      In this case the ultimate proposition is <m>|x-a|\lt \delta\implies |f(x)-f(a)|\lt \ve</m>.
      </fn> is negated!
    </p>
    <p>

    <title>The Order of Quantifiers Matters!</title>
    <p>
      We conclude this section with an important observation:
      the order of quantifiers matters critically!
      Consider, for example, the following propositions:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            For every person <m>x</m>,
            there exists a person <m>y</m> such that <m>y</m> is a friend of <m>x</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            There exists a person <m>y</m> such that,
            for every person <m>x</m>, <m>y</m> is a friend of <m>x</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      Assuming that <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> always represent people,
      we can rewrite the sentences as follows:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\forall x \,\exists y</m> such that <m>y</m> is a friend of <m>x</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\exists y</m> such that
            <m>\forall x</m> we have that <m>y</m> is a friend of <m>x</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      All we've done is to switch the order of the two quantifiers!
      How does this affect the meaning?
      Written entirely in English, the statements become:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Everyone has at least one friend.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            There is someone who is friends with everybody.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite different!
      The critical observation is that if
      <m>\exists y</m> comes after <m>x</m>,
      then <m>y</m> is <em>allowed to depend on <m>x</m>.</em>
      Each person might have a friend,
      but that friend is likely to be different depending on the person.
      If <m>\forall x</m> comes after <m>y</m>,
      then <m>x</m> cannot depend on <m>y</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Play around with the pairs of examples below.
      What are the meanings?
      Which ones are true?
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\forall\,\text{ days } \,x,\,\exists\text{ a person } y</m> such that <m>y</m> was born on day <m>x</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\exists\text{ a person } y</m> such that,
            <m>\forall\text{ days } x</m>,
            <m>y</m> was born on day <m>x</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\forall\,\text{ circles } x,\,\exists\text{ a point } y</m> such that <m>y</m> is the center of <m>x</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\exists\text{ a point } y</m> such that,
            <m>\forall\text{ circles } x</m>,
            <m>y</m> is the center of <m>x</m>.
          </p>

                Suppose you rewrite the proposition as follows
                <me>
                  \forall m,n\in A, m>n\implies m^2>n^2
                </me>.
                What is the largest collection (set) of real numbers <m>A</m> for which the proposition is <em>true</em>?
                Justify your answer.
