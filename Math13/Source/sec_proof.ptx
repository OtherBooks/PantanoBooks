  <title>Methods of Proof</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      There are four standard methods for proving a theorem <m>\timplies P{Q.}</m> In practice,
      long proofs will use several such arguments joined together.
      We have already discussed the first two types of proof in <xref ref="sec_prop">Section</xref>.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <title>Direct</title>
          <p>
            Assume <m>P</m> is true and deduce that <m>Q</m> is true.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Contrapositive</title>
          <p>
            Assume <m>\neg Q</m> and deduce <m>\neg P</m>.
            This is enough since the contrapositive
            <m>\timplies{\neg Q}{\neg P}</m> is logically equavalent to <m>\timplies P{Q.}</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Contradiction</title>
          <p>
            Assume that <m>P</m> and <m>\neg Q</m> are true and deduce a <em>contradiction</em>.
            Since <m>P\wedge\neg Q</m> implies a contradiction,
            it follows that <m>P\wedge\neg Q</m> must be <em>false.</em>
            By <xref ref="thm_negconditional">Theorem</xref>,
            we see that <m>\timplies PQ</m> is true.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Induction</title>
          <p>
            This has a completely different flavor:
            we will consider it in <xref ref="sec_ind">Chapter</xref>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of the methods has advantages and disadvantages.
      For instance,
      the direct method has the advantage of a straightforward logical flow.
      The contrapositive method is useful when the
      <em>negations</em> <m>\neg P</m>,
      <m>\neg Q</m> are simpler than <m>P</m>, <m>Q</m> themselves.
      This is often the case when one or both statements involve the
      <em>non-existence</em> of something.
      Working with their negations might give you the existence of ingredients with which you can calculate.
      Proof by contradiction has a similar advantage:
      assuming both <m>P</m> and <m>\neg Q</m> gives you two pieces of information with which you can calculate.
      Logically speaking there is no difference between the three methods,
      beyond how you visualize your argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      To illustrate the difference between direct proof,
      proof by contrapositive, and proof by contradiction,
      we prove the same simple theorem in three different ways.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm_3xodd">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose that <m>x</m> is an integer.
          If <m>3x+5</m> is even, then <m>3x</m> is odd.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We show that if <m>3x+5</m> is even then <m>3x</m> is odd.
      </p>
      <p>
        Assume that <m>3x+5</m> is even,
        then <m>3x+5=2n</m> for some integer <m>n</m>.
        Hence
        <me>
          3x=2n-5=2(n-3)+1
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is clearly odd,
        because it is of the form <sq>an even integer plus one.</sq>
      </p>
    </proof>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We show that if <m>3x</m> is even then <m>3x+5</m> is odd.
      </p>
      <p>
        Assume that <m>3x</m> is even,
        and write <m>3x=2n</m> for some integer <m>n</m>.
        Then
        <me>
          3x+5=2n+5=2(n+2)+1
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is odd, because <m>n+2</m> is an integer.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We assume that <m>3x+5</m> and <m>3x</m> are both even,
        and we deduce a falsehood.
      </p>
      <p>
        Write <m>3x+5=2m</m> and <m>3x=2n</m> for some integers <m>m</m> and <m>n</m>.
        Then
        <me>
          5=(3x+5)-3x=2m-2n=2(m-n)
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>m-n</m> is an integer,
        this says that 5 is even: a contradiction.
      </p>
    </proof>

  <subsection>
    <title>Some simple proofs</title>
    <theorem xml:id="thm_oddprod">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>m,n\in\Z</m>.
          Both <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> are odd if and only if the product <m>mn</m> is odd.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      There are really two theorems here:
      <ul>
        \itemstart{(<m>\Rightarrow</m>)} If <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> are both odd integers, then the product <m>mn</m> is odd. \itemstart{(<m>\Leftarrow</m>)} If the product <m>mn</m> of two integers is odd, then both <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> are odd.
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Often when there are two directions you'll have to prove them separately.
      Here we give a direct proof for (<m>\Rightarrow</m>) and a contapositive proof for
      (<m>\Leftarrow</m>).
    </p>
    <proof>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <title>(<m>\Rightarrow</m>)</title>
          <p>
            Let <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> be odd.
            Then <m>m=2k+1</m> and <m>n=2l+1</m> for some <m>k,l\in\Z</m>.
            Then
            <me>
              mn=(2k+1)(2l+1)=4kl+2k+2l+1=2(2kl+k+l)+1
            </me>.
            This is odd, because <m>2kl+k+l\in\Z</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>(<m>\Leftarrow</m>)</title>
          <p>
            Suppose that the integers <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> are <em>not</em> both odd.
            That is, assume that <em>at least one</em>
            of <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> is even.
            We show that the product <m>mn</m> is even.
            Without loss of generality,<fn>
            See <sq>Potential Mistakes</sq> below for what this means.
            </fn> we may assume that <m>n</m> is even,
            from which <m>n=2k</m> for some integer <m>k</m>.
            Then,
            <me>
              mn=m(2k)=2(mk)\text{ is even }
            </me>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </proof>
    <p>
      In the second part of the proof,
      we did not need to consider whether <m>m</m> was even or odd:
      if <m>n</m> is even, the product <m>mn</m> is even regardless.
      The second part would have been very difficult to prove directly.
      For instance, you might have tried to start a direct proof with:
      <me>
        \text{ Assume that \(mn\) is odd, then \(mn=2k+1\) for some integer \(k\). Then\ldots }
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      We are stuck!
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm__x_odd_if_3x_5_is_odd">
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>3x+5</m> is even, then <m>x</m> is odd.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      We can prove this directly, by the contrapositive method,
      or by contradiction.
      We'll do all of them, so you can appreciate the difference.
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Simply quote the two previous theorems.
        Because <m>3x+5</m> is even,
        <m>3x</m> must be odd by <xref ref="thm_3xodd">Theorem</xref>.
        Now, since <m>3x</m> is odd,
        both <m>3</m> and <m>x</m> are odd by <xref ref="thm_oddprod">Theorem</xref>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>x</m> is even.
        Then <m>x=2m</m> for some integer <m>m</m> and we get
        <me>
          3x+5=6m+5=2(3m+2)+1
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because <m>3m+2\in\Z</m>, we have <m>3x+5</m> odd.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Suppose that both <m>3x+5</m> and <m>x</m> are even.
        We can write <m>3x+5=2m</m> and <m>x=2k</m> for some integers <m>m</m> and <m>k</m>.
        Then
        <me>
          5= (3x+5)-3x = 2m - 6k=2(m-3k)
        </me>
        is even.
        Contradiction.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      Selecting a method of proof is often a matter of taste.
      You should be able to see the advantages and disadvantages of the various approaches.
      The direct proof is more logically straightforward,
      but it depends on two previous results.
      The contrapositive and the contradiction arguments are quicker and more self-contained,
      but they require a greater level of comfort with logic.
      Consider who you are writing for before you decide to present a slick difficult proof over a slow simple one.<fn>
      The Hungarian mathematician Paul Erd≈ës used to refer to simple,
      elegant proofs as being <sq>from the Book,</sq> as if the Almighty had a book of perfect proofs of which mere mortals might occasionally be permitted a glimpse.
      Of course, as with all matters spiritual,
      one person's Book may be very different to another's<ellipsis/>
      </fn> For even more variety,
      here is a direct proof of <xref ref="thm__x_odd_if_3x_5_is_odd">Theorem</xref>
      that does not use any previous result.
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>3x+5</m> is even, so <m>3x+5=2n</m> for some integer <m>n</m>.
        Then
        <md>
          <mrow>x\amp = (3x+5)-2x-5=2n-2x-5</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =2(x-n-3)+1</mrow>
        </md>
        is odd.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      The fact that such variety is possible just makes proving theorems even more fun!

  <subsection>
    <title>Common Mistake 1.<nbsp/><nbsp/> Generality and <sq>Without Loss of Generality</sq></title>
    <p>
      There are many common mistakes in the writing of proofs that you should be careful to avoid.
      Here are two incorrect <sq>proofs</sq> of the
      <m>\implies</m> direction of <xref ref="thm_oddprod">Theorem</xref>.
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
        <m>m=3</m> and <m>n=5</m> are both odd,
        and so <m>mn=15</m> is odd.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      This is an <em>example</em> of the theorem, not a proof.
      Examples are critical to helping you understand and believe what a theorem says,
      but they are no substitute for a proof!
      Recall the discussion in the Introduction on the usage of the word
      <em>proof</em> in English.
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>m=2k+1</m> and <m>n=2k+1</m> be odd.
        Then,
        <me>
          mn=(2k+1)(2k+1)=2(2k^2+2k)+1
        </me>
        is odd.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      The problem with this second <sq>proof</sq> is that it is insufficiently general.
      <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> are supposed to be
      <em>any</em> odd integers,
      but by setting both of them equal to <m>2k+1</m>,
      we've chosen <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> to be the same!
      Notice how the correct proof uses <m>m=2k+1</m> and <m>n=2l+1</m>,
      where we place no restriction on the integers <m>k</m> and <m>l</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      By <em>generality</em> we mean that we must make sure to consider all possibilities encompassed by the hypothesis.
      The phrase <em>Without Loss of Generality,</em>
      often shorted to WLOG, is used when a choice is made which might at first appear to restrict things but, in fact,
      does not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think back to how this was used in the the proof of <xref ref="thm_oddprod">Theorem</xref>.
      Since the integers <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> appear symmetrically in the Theorem,
      if at least one of them is even,
      then we lose nothing by assuming that the second integer <m>n</m> is even.
    </p>
    <p>
      The phrase WLOG is used to pre-empt a challenge to a proof in the sense of <em>Fake Proof 2,</em>
      as if to say to the reader:
      <sq>You might be tempted to object that my argument is not general enough.
      However, I</sq>ve thought about it, and there is no problem.'
    </p>
    <p>
      \paragraph{Common Mistake 2.Incorrect use of the equal sign}
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember that propositions should be joined by connectives:
      i.e., by <m>\implies</m> or <m>\iff</m>.
      It is very common to see students write something like
      <me>
        \text{ \(m\) is odd \(=m=2k+1\) for some integer \(k\) }
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is extremely confusing!
      If this is part of a longer argument,
      things will become very difficult to follow.
      Since <sq><m>m</m> is odd</sq> and <sq><m>m=2k+1</m> for some integer <m>k</m></sq> are both <em>propositions,</em>
      they should be linked by a <em>connective.</em> We should instead write
      <me>
        \text{ \(m\) is odd \(\iff m=2k+1\) for some integer \(k\) }
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      \paragraph{Common Mistake 3.Becoming distracted by algebra}
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is a palpably ludicrous <sq>theorem</sq> which illustrates another potential mistake.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <title>Fake Theorem</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The only number is zero.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>x</m> be any number and let <m>y=x</m>, then
        <md>
          <mrow>x=y\implies \amp x^2=xy\tag{(Multiply both sides by $x$)}</mrow>
          <mrow>\implies \amp x^2-y^2=xy-y^2\tag{(Subtract $y^2$ from both sides)}</mrow>
          <mrow>\implies \amp (x-y)(x+y)=(x-y)y\tag{(Factorize)}</mrow>
          <mrow>\implies \amp x+y=y\tag{(Divide both sides by $x-y$)}</mrow>
          <mrow>\implies \amp x=0</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      Everything is fine up to the third line,
      but then we divide by <m>x-y</m>, which is zero!
      Don't let yourself become so enamoured of logical manipulations that you forget to check the basics.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>More simple proofs</title>
    <p>
      We continue with more straightforward proofs.
      None of these results are particularly important,
      they are just exercises in deciding how to present an argument.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm_polyroot">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose that <m>x\in\R</m>.
          Then <m>x^3+2x^2-3x-10=0\implies x=2</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      We can prove this theorem using any of the three methods.
      All rely on your ability to factorize the polynomial:
      <me>
        x^3+2x^2-3x-10=(x-2)(x^2+4x+5)=(x-2)\Bigl[(x+2)^2+1\Bigr]
      </me>,
      and partly on your knowledge that <m>ab=0\iff a=0</m> or <m>b=0</m>
      (proof in the exercises).
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
        If <m>x^3+2x^2-3x-10=0</m>, then <m>(x-2)[(x+2)^2+1]=0</m>.
        Hence at least one of the factors <m>x-2</m> or <m>(x+2)^2+1</m> is zero.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the first case we conclude that <m>x=2</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second case is impossible,
        since <m>(x+2)^2\ge 0\implies (x+2)^2+1>0</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore <m>x=2</m> is the only solution.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>x\neq 2</m>.
        Then <m>x^3+2x^2-3x-10=(x-2)[(x+2)^2+1]\neq 0</m> since neither of the factors is zero.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>x^3+2x^2-3x-10=0</m> and <m>x\neq 2</m>.
        Then
        <me>
          0=x^3+2x^2-3x-10=(x-2)[(x+2)^2+1]
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>x\neq 2</m>, we have <m>x-2\neq 0</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It follows that <m>(x+2)^2+1</m> must be zero.
        However, <m>(x+2)^2+1\ge 1</m> for all real numbers <m>x</m>,
        so we have a contradiction.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      On balance, the contrapositive proof is probably the most elegant,
      but you can decide for yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      \paragraph{Common Mistake 4.Being excessively logical}
    </p>
    <p>
      The statement of <xref ref="thm_polyroot">Theorem</xref>
      is an implication <m>\timplies PQ</m> where <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are:
      <me>
        P. x^3+2x^2-3x-10=0, \qquad\qquad Q. x=2
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can make life very hard for yourself by being overly logical.
      For instance,
      you may wish take a third proposition <m>R</m>.<m>x\in\R</m>,
      and state the theorem as <m>\timplies R{(P\implies Q).}</m> This is the way of pain!
      It's easier to assume, as a universal constraint,
      that you're always dealing with real numbers;
      you can then ignore said constraint within the argument.

      Indeed, one can always append a third proposition to the front of any theorem, namely,
      <q>all math I already know.</q>
      Try to resist the temptation to be so logical that your arguments become unreadable.
      The goal is to convince the reader that the theorem is true,
      not to confuse them!

          Below is the proof of a result.
          What result is being proved?
          <proof>
            <p>
              Assume that <m>x</m> is odd.
              Then <m>x=2k+1</m> for some integer <m>k</m>.
              Then
              <me>
                2x^2-3x-4=2(2k+1)^2-3(2k+1)-4=8k^2+2k-5=2(4k^2+k-3)+1
              </me>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since <m>4k^2+k-3</m> is an integer, <m>2x^2-3x-4</m> is odd.
            </p>

          Here is another proof.
          What is the result this time?
          <proof>
            <p>
              Assume, without loss of generality,
              that <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are even.
              Then <m>x=2a</m> and <m>y=2b</m> for some integers <m>a,b</m>.
              Therefore,
              <me>
                xy+xz+yz=(2a)(2b)+(2a)z+(2b)z=2(2ab+az+bz)
              </me>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since <m>2ab+az+bz</m> is an integer, <m>xy+xz+yz</m> is even.
            </p>

          Consider the following proof of the fact that
          (for <m>m</m> an integer)
          if <m>m^2</m> is even, then <m>m</m> is even.
          Is proceeding by contradiction necessary?
          Can you re-write the proof so that it doesn't use contradiction?
          <proof>
            <p>
              Suppose, for contradiction, that <m>m^2</m> is even, but <m>m</m> is odd.
              Say <m>m = 2k + 1</m> for some integer <m>k</m>.
              Then
              <me>
                m^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1
              </me>
              is odd, contradicting that <m>m^2</m> is even.
              Thus <m>m</m> must be even.
