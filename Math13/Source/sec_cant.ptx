  <title>Cantor's Notion of Cardinality</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      During the late 1800's a German mathematician named Georg Cantor almost single-handedly overturned the foundations of mathematics.
      Prior to Cantor,
      mathematicians had understood a set to be nothing more than a collection of objects.
      Via the consideration of certain infinite sets
      (in particular his middle third set),
      Cantor showed this na√Øve idea to be woefully inadequate.
      Cantor met great resistance from many famous mathematicians and philosophers who felt his ideas to be unnatural.
      He even managed to inflame several religious scholars who believed his investigation of infinity to be an affront to the divine!
      Despite strong initial antipathy, Cantor's notion of cardinality is now universally accepted by mathematicians.
      More importantly,
      by exposing the contradictions inherent in contemporary set theory,
      he convinced mathematicians that a rigorous axiomatic approach was necessary.
      The result was a revolution in foundational mathematics,
      now known as <em>axiomatic set theory.</em>
      Indeed, Cantor's legacy is arguably the modern axiomatic nature of pure mathematics,
      where rigor dominates and mathematicians are obliged to follow logic wherever it leads,
      regardless of the bizarre paradoxes which might appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this chapter we consider the basics of Cantor's contribution,
      essentially his extension of the concept of
      <em>cardinality</em> to infinite sets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recall that if <m>A</m> is a <em>finite</em> set, then <m>\nm A</m>,
      the cardinality of <m>A</m>, is simply the number of elements in <m>A</m>.
      This definition obviously does not extend to infinite sets.
      However, cardinality has a stronger purpose than merely attaching a number to each set:
      it can be viewed as a <em>relation</em>
      and used to <em>compare</em> sets.
      It is this interpretation that turns out to apply to infinite sets.
      For example, suppose that
      <me>
        A=\{\text{ fish } ,\text{ dog } \},\text{ and }  B=\{\alpha,\beta,\gamma\}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though the elements of the sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are completely different,
      we may use cardinality to compare the sizes of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>:
      since <m>\nm A=2</m> and <m>\nm B=3</m>,
      we may write <m>\nm A\lt \nm B</m> to indicate that <m>B</m> has more elements as <m>A</m>:
      colloquially,
      <q><m>B</m> is larger than <m>A</m>.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is at this point that Cantor enters the discussion.
      By <xref ref="thm_finitecard">Theorem</xref>
      and <xref ref="cor_finitecard">Corollary</xref>,
      the condition <m>\nm A\lt \nm B</m> is equivalent to the existence of an injective (one-to-one) function
      <m>f:A\to B</m> and the non-existence of a bijection <m>g:A\to B</m>.
      For example, the function <m>f:A\to B</m> defined by
      <me>
        \text{ fish } \longmapsto\alpha,\qquad\text{ dog } \longmapsto\beta
      </me>,
      is clearly injective.
      In a sense, <xref ref="thm_finitecard">Theorem</xref>
      tells us how to compare the cardinalities of finite sets
      <em>without</em> counting their elements.
      Cantor's seemingly innocuous idea was to turn this <em>theorem</em>
      for finite sets into a <em>definition</em>
      of cardinality for all sets.[4]
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="defn_infcard">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>cardinalities</term> of two sets <m>A,B</m> are denoted <m>\nm A</m> and <m>\nm B</m>.
          We compare cardinalities as follows:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>\nm A\le\nm B\iff\exists f:A\to B</m> injective.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>\nm A=\nm B\iff\exists f:A\to B</m> bijective.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          We write <m>\nm A\lt \nm B\iff \nm A\le \nm B</m> and <m>\nm A\neq \nm B</m>.
          That is <m>\exists f:A\to B</m> injective but <m>\nexists g:A\to B</m> bijective.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Cardinality is defined as an abstract <em>property</em>
      whereby two sets can be <em>compared.</em> Otherwise said,
      it is a <em>relation.</em> To define a cardinality <m>\nm A</m> as an object,
      we need the following theorem.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm_cardequiv">
      <statement>
        <p>
          On any collection of sets,
          the relation <m>A\sim B\iff\nm A=\nm B</m> is an equivalence relation.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      The cardinality of a set <m>A</m> can then be defined to be the equivalence class of <m>A</m> with respect to this relation:
      <m>\nm A:=[A]</m>.
      It is now clear that cardinality partitions any collection of sets:
      every set has a cardinality, and no set has more than one cardinality.
      We can moreover identify the cardinalities of finite sets with the cardinal numbers <m>0,1,2,3,4,\ldots</m> in a natural way.
      To get further it is useful to introduce a symbol for the cardinality of the simplest infinite set.
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection>
    <title>Countably Infinite Sets</title>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The cardinality of the set of natural numbers <m>\N</m> is denoted <m>\aleph_0</m>,
          read <em>aleph-nought</em> or <em>aleph-null.</em>
          We say that a set <m>A</m> is <term>countably infinite,</term>
          or <term>denumerable</term><fn>
          Sometimes this is shortened to <term>countable,</term>
          although some authors use countable to mean <sq>finite or denumerable,</sq> i.e. any <m>A</m> for which <m>\nm A\le\aleph_0</m>.
          Use <term>countably infinite</term>
          or <term>denumerable</term> to avoid confusion.
          <m>\aleph</m> is the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet.
          </fn> if <m>\nm A=\aleph_0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      We will discuss in a moment why we need a new symbol,
      why <m>\infty</m> doesn't suffice.
      First we consider an example of <xref ref="defn_infcard">Definition</xref> at work.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>2\N=\{2,4,6,8,10,\ldots\}</m> be the set of positive even integers.
          The function
          <me>
            f:\N\to 2\N:n\mapsto 2n
          </me>
          is a bijection.
          It follows that <m>\nm{2\N}=\nm\N=\aleph_0</m> and we say that <m>2\N</m> is countably infinite.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      This example immediately demonstrates one of strange properties of infinite sets:
      <m>2\N</m> is a <em>proper subset</em> of <m>\N</m>,
      and yet the two sets are in bijective correspondence with one another!
      You should feel like you want to say two contradictory things simultaneously:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\N</m> has the same <sq>number of elements</sq> as <m>2\N</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\N</m> has twice the <sq>number of elements</sq> as <m>2\N</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      If this doesn't make you feel uncomfortable, then read it again!
      The remedy to your discomfort is to appreciate that <em>cardinality</em>
      and <em>number of elements</em> are different concepts.
      Replacing <sq>number of elements</sq> with <sq>cardinality</sq> in the two statements makes both true!
      Indeed it is completely legitimate to write <m>2\aleph_0=\aleph_0</m>.
      The idea of a set having a proper subset with the same cardinality can be used as a
      <em>definition</em> of infinite set
      (see <xref ref="sec_cant">Exercise</xref>.
      <xref ref="ex_cardinf"></xref>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is another example of the same phenomenon;
      <m>\N</m> has one more element than
      <m>\N_{\ge 2}</m> and yet they have the same cardinality:
      <m>\aleph_0+1=\aleph_0</m>.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The function <m>g:\N\to\N_{\ge 2}:n\mapsto n+1</m> is a bijection,
          whence <m>\N_{\ge 2}=\{2,3,4,5,\ldots\}</m> is countably infinite.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      \paragraph{Proving that a set is countably infinite}
    </p>
    <p>
      While it is possible to use any number of clever theorems to prove the denumerability of a set <m>A</m>,
      the simplest thing to imagine listing the elements in some order so that <m>A</m> <sq>looks like</sq> the natural numbers,
      or some other known countably infinite set.
      For instance,
      the above examples can be summarized by listing the elements of these sets below those of the natural numbers:
      <me>
        \begin{array}{c||ccccccccccc} \N\amp 1\amp 2\amp 3\amp 4\amp 5\amp 6\amp 7\amp 8\amp 9\amp 10\amp \cdots\\\hline\hline 2\N\amp 2\amp 4\amp 6\amp 8\amp 10\amp 12\amp 14\amp 16\amp 18\amp 20\amp \cdots\\\hline \N_{\ge 2}\amp 2\amp 3\amp 4\amp 5\amp 6\amp 7\amp 8\amp 9\amp 10\amp 11\amp \cdots \end{array}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The required bijective functions are then easy to read off!
      We use this technique to construct bijections which show the denumerability of two important examples.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm_zcount">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The integers <m>\Z</m> are countably infinite.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We must construct a bijective function <m>f:\N\to\Z</m>.
        By experimenting with listing the integers,
        we write down the first few terms of a suitable function in tabular form:
        <me>
          \begin{array}{c|ccccccccccc} n\amp 1\amp 2\amp 3\amp 4\amp 5\amp 6\amp 7\amp 8\amp 9\amp 10\amp \cdots\\\hline f(n)\amp 0\amp 1\amp -1\amp 2\amp -2\amp 3\amp -3\amp 4\amp -4\amp 5\amp \cdots \end{array}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Two things should be clear from the table:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <title>Surjectivity</title>
            <p>
              <nbsp/><nbsp/> Every integer appears at least once in the second row.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title>Injectivity</title>
            <p>
              <nbsp/><nbsp/> No integer appears more than once in the second row.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        It follows that the function <m>f</m> is bijective.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      You might object that the above argument is too quick,
      and perhaps you don't trust the reasoning.
      Does the table really define a function?
      Is it really obvious that the function is bijective?
      We can be more formal and explicit,
      but the cost is that the big picture becomes less clear.
      Our function may be written
      <me>
        f(n)=\begin{cases}\frac 12n\amp \text{ if \(n\) is even, } \\ -\frac 12(n-1)\amp \text{ if \(n\) is odd. } \end{cases}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we check that this is bijective:
      <md>
        -5pt]  (\emph{Injectivity}) Let <m>m,n\in\N</m>, and suppose that <m>f(m)=f(n)</m>. Without loss of generality, there are three cases to consider. \begin{ptabular}{(\emph{<m>m</m> even, <m>n</m> odd})} (\emph{<m>m,n</m> both even})\amp <m>f(m)=f(n)\implies \frac m2=\frac n2\implies m=n</m>.\\ (\emph{<m>m,n</m> both odd})\amp <m>f(m)=f(n)\implies-\frac 12(m-1)=-\frac 12(n-1)\implies m=n</m>.\\ (\emph{<m>m</m> even, <m>n</m> odd})\amp <m>f(m)=f(n)\implies\frac m2=-\frac 12(n-1)\implies m+n=1</m>. But <m>m,n\in\N</m>, so <m>m+n\ge 2</m>, which is a contradiction. \end{ptabular} Therefore <m>f</m> is injective.\\[-5pt]  (\emph{Surjectivity}) With a little calculation, you should be able to see that, for any <m>z\in\Z</m>, there exists a positive integer <m>n</m> such that <m>f(n)=z</m>, namely: \[z=\begin{cases}f(2z)\amp \text{ if \(z>0\), } \\ f(1-2z)\amp \text{ if \(z\le 0\). } \end{cases}
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence <m>f</m> is surjective.
    </p>
    <p>
      For basic examples you are encouraged to use the listing/pictorial construction rather than explicitly writing everything out.
      Training your intuition is more important than the formality here!
      Indeed we would likely have been unable to come up with an explicit formula for <m>f</m> without the table,
      and it is easier to get a feel for what <m>f</m> is using the table rather than the formula.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you build up examples,
      you no longer have to compare countably infinite sets directly to the natural numbers.
      A set <m>B</m> is countably infinite if and only if there exists a bijection <m>f:A\to B</m> where <m>A</m> is
      <em>any countably infinite set</em>.
      This holds because the composition of bijective function is also bijective
      (<xref ref="thm_compinjsurj">Theorem</xref>).
      For instance,
      we immediately see that the set of even integers <m>2\Z</m> is countably infinite because
      <me>
        f:\Z\to 2\Z:z\mapsto 2z
      </me>
      is a bijection,
      and because we now know that <m>\Z</m> is countably infinite.
      We use this approach to help prove the following result,
      the first of Cantor's truly counter-intuitive revelations.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm_qcount">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The rational numbers <m>\Q</m> are countably infinite.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      We prove the Theorem in stages.
      First we construct a bijection between the natural numbers <m>\N</m> and the positive rational numbers <m>\Q^+</m>.
      We then modify this to obtain a bijection between the integers <m>\Z</m> and the full set of rational numbers <m>\Q</m>.
      By the previous Theorem,
      it follows that <m>\Q</m> must be countably infinite.
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
        For each pair of natural numbers <m>a,b</m>,
        place the fraction <m>\frac ab\in\Q^+</m> in the <m>a</m>th column and <m>b</m>th row of an infinite square as shown below.
        Now list the positive rational numbers by tracing the diagonals as shown,
        deleting any number that has already appeared in the list
        (<m>\frac 22=\frac 11</m>, <m>\frac 64=\frac 32</m>, etc.).
      </p>
      <sidebyside>
        <image width="73%" source="cardinality-01-qcount"/>
        The infinite square
        <image width="73%" source="cardinality-02-qcount"/>
        Trace diagonals and delete repeats
      </sidebyside>
      <p>
        We obtain the <em>ordered set</em>
        <me>
          \{a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,\ldots\}=\left\{{\frac 11,\,\frac 21,\,\frac 12,\,\frac 13,\,\frac 31,\,\frac 41,\,\frac 32,\,\frac 23,\,\frac 14,\,\frac 15,\,\ldots}\right\}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now define the function <m>f:\N\to\Q^+</m> by <m>f(n)=a_n</m>.
        This is certainly a function.
        We claim that it is a bijection.
        <me>
          -5pt]  (\emph{Injectivity}) Let \(m,n\in\N\), and suppose that \(f(n)=f(m)\). Then \(a_m=a_n\). In the above construction we deleted any rational number which had already appeared in the list. Thus \(a_m\) can only equal \(a_n\) if \(m=n\).\\[-5pt]  (\emph{Surjectivity}) A positive rational number \(\frac ab\) appears in the \(a\)th column and \(b\)th row of the square (and in many other places, \(\frac ab=\frac{2a}{2b}=\cdots\)). We only delete a fraction \(\frac ab\) if it has already appeared in the list, therefore every positive rational lies in the range of \(f\).\\[-5pt]  To finish things off, we extend the function to all rational numbers by \[g:\Z\to\Q:n\mapsto\begin{cases}f(n)\amp \text{ if } n>0,\\ 0\amp \text{ if } n=0,\\ -f(-n)\amp \text{ if } n\lt 0. \end{cases}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        We are merely using <m>f</m> to identify the negative integers with the negative rationals.
        It is immediate that <m>g:\Z\to\Q</m> is a bijection.
        Appealing to <xref ref="thm_zcount">Theorem</xref>,
        we deduce that <m>\nm{\Q}=\nm{\Z}=\aleph_0</m>,
        and so <m>\Q</m> is countably infinite.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      This result should surprise you!
      Any sensible person should feel that there are far,
      far more rational numbers than integers,
      and yet the two sets have the same cardinality.
      Bizarre.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are other countably infinite sets that appear to be even larger than <m>\Q</m>.
      For example, we can show that the Cartesian product
      <m>\N\times\N</m> is countably infinite:
      use almost the same proof as for <m>\Q^+</m> except that there are no repeats to delete.
      For a much larger-seeming yet still countably infinite set,
      consider the <em>algebraic numbers:</em>
      <me>
        \big\{x\in\R:p(x)=0\text{ for some polynomial \(p\) with integer coefficients } \big\}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Algebraic numbers are the zeros of polynomials with integer coefficients.
      Clearly any rational number <m>\frac ab</m> is algebraic,
      since it satisfies <m>p(x)=0</m> for <m>p(x)=bx-a</m>.
      There are many more algebraic numbers than rational numbers: e.g.
      <m>\sqrt[5]{2}-3</m> is algebraic since it is a root of the polynomial <m>p(x)=(x+3)^5-2=0</m>.
      Not all real numbers are algebraic however:
      those which aren't, such as <m>\pi</m> and <m>e</m>,
      are termed <em>transcendental.</em>

    <title>The least infinite cardinal?</title>
    <p>
      We originally introduced the symbol
      <m>\aleph_0</m> to represent the cardinality of the <sq>simplest</sq> infinite set.
      While the natural numbers are certainly infinite and straightforward,
      is there any more compelling reason why we should consider them to be the
      <em>most simple</em> infinite set?
      One reason lies in the following result.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm_finitealeph">
      <statement>
        <p>
          <m>A</m> is a finite set if and only if <m>\nm A\lt \aleph_0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      Otherwise said, every infinite set has cardinality
      <em>at least as large</em> as the natural numbers:
      <m>\aleph_0</m> may be considered the least infinite cardinal.
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
        (<m>\Longrightarrow</m>)The <m>n=0</m> case is left to the Exercises.
        Suppose that <m>\nm A=n\ge 1</m> so that we may list the elements of <m>A</m> as <m>\{a_1,\ldots,a_n\}</m>.
        We must prove two things:

      Of course, this doesn't answer the question of whether there exist infinite sets with larger cardinality than <m>\aleph_0</m>,
      though we shall answer this in the next section.

        <term><m>\aleph_0</m> versus <m>\infty</m>:
        what's the difference?</term>
      </p>
      <p>
        It can be difficult to grasp why
        <m>\aleph_0</m> and <m>\infty</m> are not the same thing.
        The problem is compounded by references to an <sq>infinite number</sq> of objects whenever the cardinality of a set is not finite.
        This loose phrase is commonly used,
        but risks conflating the concepts of <sq>infinite set</sq> and <sq>infinity.</sq>
      </p>
      <p>
        So what is the difference between <m>\aleph_0</m> and <m>\infty</m>?
        If there aren't an <sq>infinite number</sq> of natural numbers,
        how many are there?
        <xref ref="thm_finitealeph">Theorem</xref>
        says that <m>\aleph_0</m> is <sq>larger than any natural number.</sq> Is this not what we mean by infinity?
        The reason we need a new symbol <m>\aleph_0</m>,
        and why it and <m>\infty</m> are different, is twofold:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              As we shall see shortly,
              there are infinite sets with greater cardinality than <m>\aleph_0</m>:
              in a na√Øve sense, there are multiple infinities.
              The single symbol <m>\infty</m> is insufficient to distinguish sets with different infinite cardinalities.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              More philosophically, <m>\aleph_0</m> is an
              <em>object</em> in its own right;
              an object to which the cardinality of some set may be equal.
              Indeed, by <xref ref="thm_cardequiv">Theorem</xref>,
              <m>\aleph_0</m> is an equivalence class.
              By contrast, <m>\infty</m> is typically not an object.
              The symbol <m>\infty</m> is mostly used in
              <em>interval notation</em>
              and when talking about <em>limits:</em>
              in neither case does the symbol represent an object.
              For example:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    The interval <m>(2,\infty)</m> is the set of all real numbers greater than 2.
                    We don't say <sq>greater than 2 and
                    <em>less than infinity.</em></sq>
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <m>\lim\limits_{x\to 3}\frac 1{(x-3)^2}=\infty</m> means that the function
                    <m>f(x)=\frac 1{(x-3)^2}</m> gets unboundedly larger as <m>x</m> approaches 3.
                    It is incorrect to say that <m>f(x)</m> <sq>approaches infinity.</sq> It is even worse to write <m>f(3)=\frac 1{(3-3)^2}=\infty</m>.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        The challenge of Cantor's notion of cardinality is to appreciate that the question,
        <sq>How many natural numbers are there?</sq> is meaningless!
