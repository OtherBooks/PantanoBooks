  <title>Divisibility and the Euclidean Algorithm</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this section we introduce the notion of <em>congruence</em>:
      a generalization of the idea of separating all integers into <sq>even</sq> and <sq>odd.</sq> At its most basic it involves going back to elementary school when you first learned division and would write something similar to
      <me>
        33\div 5=6\mathsf{\,r\,}3\qquad\text{ and read `6 remainder 3.' }
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The study of congruence is of fundamental importance to Number Theory,
      and provides some of the most straightforward examples of Groups and Rings.
      We will cover the basics in this section<mdash/>enough to compute with<mdash/>then return later for more formal observations.
