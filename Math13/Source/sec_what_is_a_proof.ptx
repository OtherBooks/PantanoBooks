  <title>Proof</title>
  <p>
    How can you convince someone that you're telling the truth?
    Depending on the situation, there are varying amounts of show and tell.
    If you're a defense attorney,
    you tell a story to the jury,
    backed up with evidence and witness testimony,
    that instills some reasonable doubt that your client committed the crime.
    If you're a physicist or chemist,
    you run experiments and collect statistics that are sufficiently close to your predicted values.
    If you're an investigative journalist,
    you piece together excerpts from primary sources and interviews with key people to construct a consistent narrative that's as complete as possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    Critically, the attorney's client doesn't actually need to be innocent <mdash/> the jury just needs to doubt their guilt.
    The scientist's results might be consistent with her predictions,
    but it might not be for the reason she purports.
    The journalist may have neglected to interview an important,
    but peripheral person of interest or a condemning document may have been destroyed that would otherwise completely upend their story.
    Even when all three of these characters act with the best intentions,
    there's still a gap between what they present to the world and the underlying fact of the matter.
    Of course, there are reasons these disciplines have differing standards of truth.
    These could be liberal values concerning justice,
    the physical limitations of our measurements,
    or the constraints of time, money and access to information.

  <p>
    Let's compare and contrast these examples with what it means to convince someone in mathematics.
    Up to this point,
    the only convincing you've probably had to do is showing that your calculations are correct.
    You'd start with some given expression like an integral and then jump from equals sign to equals sign using algebraic manipulations and identities.
    Eventually, you'd get some number that you'd box and say
    <q>there's my answer.</q>
    If asked for justification, you'd point to your chain of equalities and say
    <q>there it is.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    But sometimes we want to use reasoning that isn't just algebra.
    You might have gotten a taste of this in your high school geometry class where you had to write <em>proofs</em>.
    Rather than give a technical definition of what a proof is,
    let's look at an example of what a proof can be.
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="thm_pythagorean">
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>a\leq b\leq c</m> are the side lengths of a right triangle,
        then <m>a^2+b^2 = c^2</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Consider a square with side length <m>a+b</m> with four congruent copies of our triangle arranged as in <xref ref="fig_pythag1">Figure</xref>.
      The total area of the square is <m>(a+b)^2</m>,
      but if we add up the areas of the four triangles and the square in the middle
      (try to prove that this is indeed a square!),
      we get <m>2ab+c^2</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let's slide the lower-left triangle up and to the right so that it forms a rectangle with the upper-right triangle.
      Then slide the upper-left triangle down and the lower-right triangle to the left so they form a rectangle as well.
      If we add up the areas of the two rectangles and the two smaller squares,
      we get <m>2ab+a^2+b^2</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the area of the whole square hasn't changed, so we must have that
      <me>
        2ab+c^2 = 2ab+a^2+b^2
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we subtract <m>2ab</m> from both sides,
      we arrive at the desired conclusion.

    \paragraph{Discussion Questions}
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Are you convinced by this proof?
          If so, why?
          If not, what feels off?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Would this proof work without the picture?
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    Even though we finished this proof with an equation
    (the theorem concerns an equation after all),
    the <em>essence</em> of the proof is in the picture.
    The picture informed which equations we wrote down.
    That being said, we shouldn't get too attached to the picture.
    Are all four angles in our square
    <em>really</em> right angles?
    Are the four triangles <em>exactly</em> congruent to each other?
    If it turned out that one of the line segments we drew wasn't perfectly straight,
    would we need to scrap the whole argument?
    What if we want to apply this reasoning to a right triangle with proportions very different from the ones we drew here?
  </p>
  <p>
    The point here is that the picture isn't a proof in and of itself.
    Rather, it serves to remind us of our assumptions and their consequences.
