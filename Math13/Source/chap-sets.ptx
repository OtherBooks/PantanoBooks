  <title>Sets and Functions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Sets are the fundamental building blocks of mathematics.
      In the sub-discipline of Set Theory,
      mathematicians define all basic notions,
      including number, addition, function,
      etc., purely in terms of sets.
      In such a system it can take over 100 pages of discussion to
      <em>prove</em> that <m>1+1=2</m>!
      We will not be anything like so rigorous.
      Indeed, before one can accept that such formality has its place in mathematics,
      a level of familiarity with sets and their basic operations is necessary.
